emission|gas|intergovernmental panel on climate change,"Increasing scientific evidence about the possibility of global climate change in the 1980s led to a growing awareness that human activities have been contributing to substantial increases in the atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse <span class=""highlight"">gases</span>. Concerned that anthropogenic increases of <span class=""highlight"">emissions</span> enhance the natural greenhouse effect and would result, on average, in an additional warming of the Earths surface, the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) and the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) established the <span class=""highlight"">Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change</span> (<span class=""highlight"">IPCC</span>) in 1988. The Panel focused on: assessing <span class=""highlight"">scientific information</span> related to the various aspects of climate change; evaluating the environmental and socio-<span class=""highlight"">economic impacts</span> of climate change; and formulating response strategies for the management of global climate change. In 1990, the finalization and adoption of the <span class=""highlight"">IPCC</span> report and the Second World Climate Conference focused further attention on climate change."
differentiated responsibilities|co2|emission|technology transfer|technology,"On 11 December 1990, the 45th session of the UN General Assembly adopted a resolution that established the Intergovernmental Negotiating Committee for a Framework Convention on Climate Change (INC/FCCC). Supported by UNEP and WMO, the mandate of the INC/FCCC was to prepare an effective framework convention on climate change. The INC held five sessions between February 1991 and May 1992. During these meetings, participants from over 150 states discussed the difficult and contentious issues of <span class=""highlight"">binding commitments</span>, targets and timetables for the reduction of <span class=""highlight"">carbon dioxide</span> <span class=""highlight"">emissions</span>, <span class=""highlight"">financial mechanisms</span>, <span class=""highlight"">technology</span> transfer, and common but <span class=""highlight"">differentiated responsibilities</span> of developed and developing countries. The INC sought to achieve a consensus that could be supported by a broad majority, rather than drafting a treaty that dealt with specific policies that might limit participation."
emission|co2|forest|sink|energy,"Since the adoption of the Convention, the INC has met five more times to consider the following items: matters relating to commitments; matters relating to arrangements for the <span class=""highlight"">financial mechanism</span> and for technical and <span class=""highlight"">financial support</span> to developing countries; procedural and legal matters; and institutional matters. During these INC sessions, scientific work was done to improve the methodologies for measuring <span class=""highlight"">emissions</span> from various sources, but the larger scientific problem is choosing the best methodology to estimate the removal of <span class=""highlight"">carbon dioxide</span> by <span class=""highlight"">sinks</span>, namely <span class=""highlight"">oceans</span> and <span class=""highlight"">forests</span>. The other major task before negotiators has been to work on the difficult issue of <span class=""highlight"">financial support</span> for implementation, particularly for developing country Parties who will require new and additional resources to obtain data and implement <span class=""highlight"">energy</span>- efficient technologies and other necessary measures."
emission|gas,"The INC held its ninth session from 7-18 February 1994, in Geneva. In discussions on matters relating to commitments, delegates examined methodologies for calculations/inventories of <span class=""highlight"">emissions</span> and removal of greenhouse <span class=""highlight"">gases</span>, the first review of information communicated by Annex I parties, the role of the subsidiary bodies established by the Convention, and criteria for <span class=""highlight"">joint implementation</span>. Delegates also reviewed the <span class=""highlight"">adequacy of commitments</span>. The need for broader action beyond the year 2000 on the commitments in Article 4.2(a) and (b) was considered, based on the understanding that the provisions of this article refer to the present decade."
funding|financial resources|financial mechanism,"In its discussions on matters relating to the <span class=""highlight"">financial mechanism</span> and technical and <span class=""highlight"">financial support</span> to developing country Parties, the Committee chose to focus on the implementation of Article 11. It was agreed that only developing countries that are Parties to the Convention would be eligible to receive <span class=""highlight"">funding</span> upon <span class=""highlight"">entry into force</span> of the Convention. There was general support for a cost-effective arrangement for the Permanent Secretariat that would encourage collaboration with other secretariats. The question of the <span class=""highlight"">location of the Permanent Secretariat</span> was not resolved, but it was agreed that the Permanent Secretariat will start operating on 1 January 1996, and, in the interest of continuity, will be organized along the same lines as the Interim Secretariat."
adaptation and response measures|gef|financial mechanism|funding|technology transfer|technology,"On matters related to the <span class=""highlight"">financial mechanism</span>, countries agreed to stage-by- stage <span class=""highlight"">funding</span> modality for <span class=""highlight"">adaptation measures</span>. The temporary arrangements between the Committee and the <span class=""highlight"">Global Environment Facility</span> (<span class=""highlight"">GEF</span>) was also adopted. On agreed full incremental costs, the Committee concluded that this issue was complex and that further discussion was needed. Delegates also concluded that the concept should be flexible and applied on a case-by-case basis. The Interim Secretariat was requested to prepare a paper on <span class=""highlight"">transfer of technology and delegations were invited to submit their views on this issue. On the subject of the Subsidiary Body for Scientific and Technological Advice (SBSTA) and the Subsidiary Body for Implementation (SBI), the provisional recommendation to the COP is that the SBSTA will be the link between the scientific and technical assessments and the information provided by international bodies and the policy-oriented needs of the COP. The SBI will develop recommendations to assist the COP in its assessment and review of the implementation of the Convention.</span>"
reducing emissions|emission|gas,"Subsequent to INC-10, Trinidad and Tobago, on behalf of the Alliance of <span class=""highlight"">Small Island</span> States (AOSIS), submitted a draft protocol to the Interim Secretariat. This protocol, which was distributed to other Parties, calls for a <span class=""highlight"">reduction of emissions of greenhouse gases by at least 20% by the year 2005.</span>"
all gases|greenhouse gas emissions|emission|gas|co2,"In other statements, Antigua and Barbuda, on behalf of the Caribbean Community, said industrialized countries should take significant steps to reduce <span class=""highlight"">emissions</span> of <span class=""highlight"">carbon dioxide</span> and <span class=""highlight"">other greenhouse gases. These concerns are adequately addressed by the AOSIS draft protocol on the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. He urged that the debate on the AOSIS draft protocol begin at INC-11, with its subsequent adoption at the first COP. Austria, supported by New Zealand, stated that commitments must be strengthened and that a reduction in carbon dioxide emissions after the year 2000 is necessary to achieve the goals of the Convention.</span>"
technology|technology transfer,"Algeria, on behalf of the G-77, urged parties to the Convention not to go beyond the original mandate. Distinct categories of parties should have distinct responsibilities and any attempt to undermine this principle through innovative concepts, such as <span class=""highlight"">joint implementation</span>, would have negative repercussions. China said that it did not approve of any attempt to make developing countries accept concrete restrictive targets through amending the Convention or negotiating new protocols. India said there is still a lack of clarity on several concepts in the Convention, including full incremental costs, <span class=""highlight"">joint implementation</span> and transfer of <span class=""highlight"">technology</span>. While India recognized the need to address reduction of greenhouse <span class=""highlight"">gases</span> beyond the year 2000, he did not believe that this is the time to strengthen commitments, since INC negotiations on a new protocol could distract from establishing a fundamental basis to implement the existing Convention."
1990 levels|new commitment|emission|gas|co2|greenhouse gas concentrations,"INC Chair   RaÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½l Estrada-Oyuela   opened INC-11 by noting a sense of satisfaction that 118 States and the EEC have ratified the Convention. He said that one of the most important tasks of this session is the review of the first 15 national reports submitted by Annex I developed countries. With regard to commitments, he stated that while some believe that after the year 2000 countries can increase their <span class=""highlight"">CO2</span> <span class=""highlight"">emissions</span>, this is not the case. Annex I countries are legally bound to reduce their <span class=""highlight"">emissions</span> to <span class=""highlight"">1990 levels</span> by the year 2000. If this is not enough to stabilize <span class=""highlight"">greenhouse gas concentrations</span>, <span class=""highlight"">new commitments</span> will be necessary. Agreement on these <span class=""highlight"">new commitments</span> will not be easy and may require greater involvement of large developing countries."
intergovernmental panel on climate change|emissions scenarios,"In his opening statement,   Bert Bolin  , Chair of the <span class=""highlight"">Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change</span> (<span class=""highlight"">IPCC</span>), raised three issues: recent findings regarding radiative forcing of the atmosphere and the interpretation of the <span class=""highlight"">IPCC</span> <span class=""highlight"">emission</span> <span class=""highlight"">scenarios</span> that are dealt with in the <span class=""highlight"">IPCC</span> 1994 Special Report; the intensified general debate concerning knowledge about climate change; and the role of the <span class=""highlight"">IPCC</span> in the future work of the Convention. With regard to the latter, he said that it is most important that the future status of the <span class=""highlight"">IPCC</span> relative to the COP be clarified so that countries can decide on ways and means to support the <span class=""highlight"">IPCC</span> financially."
funding|gef|financial mechanism,"Mohamed El-Ashry  , CEO and Chair of the <span class=""highlight"">Global Environment Facility</span> (<span class=""highlight"">GEF</span>), noted that the Interim Secretariat of the Convention and the <span class=""highlight"">GEF</span> have reached agreement on <span class=""highlight"">GEF</span> arrangements to <span class=""highlight"">fund</span> enabling activities and preparations for national communications. At its first meeting in July, the <span class=""highlight"">GEF</span> Council approved a two-track programme of work. The first track will produce an overarching operational strategy, as well as specific strategies for the focal areas. The second will allocate limited resources to a relatively small number of activities on which guidance is fairly clear. He added that the <span class=""highlight"">GEF</span>, in its replenished and restructured form, responds to the requirements of Articles 21(3) and 11 of the Convention, and is ready to serve as the permanent <span class=""highlight"">financial mechanism</span> for the Convention."
reducing emissions|emission|gwp|gas|uncertainties|intergovernmental panel on climate change,"Working Group I first addressed Agenda Item 7, Questions for the <span class=""highlight"">IPCC</span> Chair. France, on behalf of the EU, asked Dr. Bolin whether substantial <span class=""highlight"">reductions in emissions would be necessary and if Annex I countries actions would be insufficient to prevent greenhouse warming. New Zealand inquired about the inclusion of short- lived gases in warming estimates and how uncertainties regarding Global Warming Potentials (GWPs) could be reduced. Bolin responded that the IPCC believes GWPs are a useful approach even though short-lived gases cannot be included. Japan called for greater mitigation by all parties.</span>"
funding|precipitation|uncertainties|social costs|models|intergovernmental panel on climate change|sea level rise|mitigation options|emissions scenarios|forest|sink,"Benin inquired whether the <span class=""highlight"">IPCC</span> had developed methodologies for analyzing regional effects on <span class=""highlight"">precipitation</span>. Bolin said that current <span class=""highlight"">models</span> could not produce consistent regional results. The Netherlands said it was obvious that commitments need to be strengthened and that action should be taken at COP-1. He also recommended continued <span class=""highlight"">funding</span> for the <span class=""highlight"">IPCC</span>. The US asked what the <span class=""highlight"">IPCC</span> recommended for next steps in its work and how the <span class=""highlight"">IPCC</span> relates to the SBSTA. He recommended that support for the <span class=""highlight"">IPCC</span> budget could be part of INC discussions, but should also be taken up by the COP. Bolin suggested three areas for joint work with the SBSTA: sources and <span class=""highlight"">sinks</span>, recent changes and methodologies. China questioned the effects of solar activity, the role of clouds, <span class=""highlight"">forests</span> and the biosphere, and long-term cycles of natural climatic variation. Bolin noted that it is possible to distinguish between natural variations and those from <span class=""highlight"">fossil fuels</span>, and the issue in long-term cycles is whether adjustments can be made if the rate of change is accelerating. Saudi Arabia, supported by Kuwait, suggested that increasing <span class=""highlight"">uncertainties</span> in <span class=""highlight"">emissions</span> <span class=""highlight"">scenarios</span> with longer time scales, downward revisions in estimates of <span class=""highlight"">sea level</span> rise, and differences in <span class=""highlight"">social costs</span> of <span class=""highlight"">mitigation options</span> require a cautious approach on <span class=""highlight"">adequacy of commitments</span>."
vulnerable|emission|gwp|uncertainties|intergovernmental panel on climate change,"AGENDA ITEM 7(D) - METHODOLOGICAL ISSUES:   The Secretariat invited discussion of document A/AC/237/84, on methodological issues. France, on behalf of the EU, recommended continued use of draft guidelines for national communication, and collaboration between subsidiary bodies of the Convention and the <span class=""highlight"">IPCC</span> on revisions of the guidelines. He said additional effort should be made to reduce <span class=""highlight"">uncertainty</span> in <span class=""highlight"">GWPs</span> but that parties should use them if they wish. Japan supported the <span class=""highlight"">GWP</span> position and said that the inventory methodologies could be used by Annex 1 and non-Annex 1 Parties. Australia said Parties should continue to have the <span class=""highlight"">flexibility</span> to use country-specific approaches that are comparable to <span class=""highlight"">IPCC</span> guidelines and also supported continued use of <span class=""highlight"">GWPs</span>. Poland said revisions of guidelines should follow periodicity of national communications. The US supported use of <span class=""highlight"">GWPs</span> and <span class=""highlight"">IPCC</span> <span class=""highlight"">vulnerability</span> assessment methodologies. He suggested future work on inventory guidelines, impacts and mitigation methodologies and others will ultimately be the responsibility of SBSTA and the Convention Parties, not the <span class=""highlight"">IPCC</span> or other multilateral organizations, and that COP-1 could remand the issue to SBSTA. The International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) asked whether the Convention will be actively involved in controlling aircraft <span class=""highlight"">emissions</span>, suggesting that this would duplicate ICAOs activities. Romania said inventories may be difficult based on available data, and that the COP should take this into consideration. China said <span class=""highlight"">IPCC</span> guidelines are difficult to apply, especially for developing countries. He suggested calculating <span class=""highlight"">emissions</span> <span class=""highlight"">per capita</span> as an alternative methodology. The Chair said she would develop a revised draft based on delegates comments."

funding|gef,"The Working Group first addressed Agenda Item 8(a), Questions to the <span class=""highlight"">GEF</span> Chair/CEO Mohammed El-Ashry. France, on behalf of the EU, asked about the criteria for choosing the projects to be presented at the next <span class=""highlight"">GEF</span> council meeting, and possible tools for <span class=""highlight"">GEF</span> action on climate change. El-Ashry responded that the overarching <span class=""highlight"">GEF</span> strategy would emerge as the Convention proceeds, and that the existing guidelines for projects were primarily for enabling activities. He stated the <span class=""highlight"">GEF</span> alone does not have sufficient <span class=""highlight"">funding</span> for all proposals and must look to other means to mobilize resources."
funding|gef,"Following a question from Antigua and Barbuda on the role of the COP and the <span class=""highlight"">GEF</span> in project consideration, and recourse for projects denied <span class=""highlight"">funding</span>, El- Ashry stated that the division of labor between the <span class=""highlight"">GEF</span>, the COP and the INC is contained in the Convention, and that continuation of the cooperative spirit between <span class=""highlight"">GEF</span> and the COP in project <span class=""highlight"">development</span> would help avoid misunderstandings. Colombia later asked for further clarification, and El- Ashry again noted that both <span class=""highlight"">GEF</span> and Convention secretariats will be involved in the decision making process."
funding|gef,"Benin asked: 1) how many projects can the <span class=""highlight"">GEF</span> launch per country; 2) is there a regional distribution plan for <span class=""highlight"">GEF</span> projects; and 3) is there a plan for distribution of <span class=""highlight"">funds</span> among the GEFs four focal areas. El-Ashry replied that the number of projects per country depends on the capacity of the country and the institution. Rules on regional distribution or allocation existed only in the <span class=""highlight"">pilot phase</span> and distribution of <span class=""highlight"">funds</span> among focal areas has not yet been done, but may be in the future. Saudi Arabia stated that the <span class=""highlight"">GEF</span> Council has overlooked the importance of implementing activities in developing countries. These countries need substantial <span class=""highlight"">funding</span> to establish a sound <span class=""highlight"">infrastructure</span>, and it appears, based on the <span class=""highlight"">GEF</span> Council figures on <span class=""highlight"">funding</span> for enabling activities, that the <span class=""highlight"">GEF</span> will face high administrative costs in implementing projects. El-Ashry answered that they are currently trying to deal with coordination at the country level to ensure the provision of resources, not administrative costs."
funding|gef|financial mechanism,"AGENDA ITEM 8(B)  MAINTENANCE OF INTERIM ARRANGEMENTS:   The Working Group then considered the draft decision on maintenance of interim financial arrangements. The EU, the US, Australia, Canada, Japan and Poland supported designating the <span class=""highlight"">GEF</span> as the permanent entity entrusted with the operation of the <span class=""highlight"">financial mechanism</span>. The Philippines, on behalf of the G-77, Peru, China and Benin commented that progress had been made during the <span class=""highlight"">GEF</span> restructuring, but the <span class=""highlight"">GEF</span> needs further modification in its representation as well as additional <span class=""highlight"">funds</span> before it can be designated as the permanent <span class=""highlight"">financial mechanism</span>. The G-77 offered amendments to the draft, so that the <span class=""highlight"">GEF</span> would remain the interim <span class=""highlight"">financial mechanism</span> and the situation would be reviewed at the third session of the COP."
reducing emissions|emission|gas,"On Monday, delegates agreed that AOSIS could present its draft protocol to the Committee on Wednesday. This protocol, which calls for a <span class=""highlight"">reduction of emissions of greenhouse gases by at least 20% by the year 2005, has been the subject of discussion in the corridors and during the intersessional period. It appears as though an agreement has been reached whereupon there will be no negotiation of this protocol until the COP. Although the Chair made the point that the protocol might be discussed during Working Group Is review of the adequacy of commitments on Wednesday afternoon, few expect much progress at this session.</span>"

The room will be announced."
gas|co2|emissions inventories|emission|all gases,"AGENDA ITEM 7(a)  REVIEW OF NATIONAL COMMUNICATIONS:   Working Group I resumed consideration of the Secretariats synthesis report and recommendations on national communications. Poland said the Secretariats recommended schedule of national communications  every two years  is too expensive for Parties and would not produce new information. He also said the recommended annual periodicity for <span class=""highlight"">emissions</span> inventories was too short. Japan said the due date for the second national communications should be delayed, but he supported annual <span class=""highlight"">emissions</span> inventory updates. He said <span class=""highlight"">CO2</span> <span class=""highlight"">emissions</span> data could be collected with a reasonable workload, but that inclusion of other <span class=""highlight"">gases</span> should be optional. The US said that the Secretariats report focused too much on <span class=""highlight"">CO2</span>, suggesting that Parties needed to focus on all <span class=""highlight"">gases</span>. He did not think Parties should be named in the report. He supported the Secretariats recommended time frames, but urged <span class=""highlight"">development</span> of guidelines for developing country Parties."
baselines,"Hungary recommended averaging several years <span class=""highlight"">emissions</span> rather than using one year for an inventory <span class=""highlight"">baseline</span>. He suggested biannual inventories and a four- year periodicity for full communications, and supported naming Parties in the synthesis report. Mauritius said the Secretariat should consider non-Annex 1 Parties' communications in reviewing guidelines. New Zealand said while a decision on periodicity of national communications could wait for more experience from the SBSTA, she supports annual inventories."
emission|all gases,"Australia supported annual <span class=""highlight"">emissions</span> updates, but recommended that the COP define comparable reporting years. Canada said Parties need to resolve deviations from the guidelines, requested <span class=""highlight"">flexibility</span> on the exact date for submissions and supported annual inventories by Annex 1 Parties. China said the 15 submissions fail to meet the Conventions requirements because many lack documentation and evaluations of policies, and do not describe financial contributions to developing countries. France, on behalf of the EU, said that the synthesis report should be more flexible in naming Parties, periodicity could await subsidiary bodies advice, and annual inventories should be extended to <span class=""highlight"">all GHGs</span>. Argentina supported naming Parties and the Secretariats proposed timetable. The Climate Action Network presented an NGO evaluation of 20 OECD countries plans, noting that although procedural implementation is moving forward, more needs to be done substantively. Without a protocol, further progress would be undermined as Parties encounter political difficulties."
gef|financial mechanism,"AGENDA ITEM 8(b)  MAINTENANCE OF INTERIM FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS:   During the discussion of the Co-Chairs draft decision, Brazil, Uganda, the Republic of Korea, Malaysia and Iran supported the G-77 amendments, which clarified that the <span class=""highlight"">GEF</span> shall continue to be the interim entity entrusted with the operation of the <span class=""highlight"">financial mechanism</span>. Uganda and Malaysia felt that the relationship between the <span class=""highlight"">GEF</span> Council and the COP requires further work and evaluation. The Netherlands and Norway said that the restructured <span class=""highlight"">GEF</span> is now in conformity with the conditions in Article 21.3 and should permanently operate the <span class=""highlight"">financial mechanism</span>. The US, supported by the Netherlands, warned that if the question of the <span class=""highlight"">financial mechanism</span> is left open, it will sow doubt among people outside this process."
funding|gef|financial mechanism,"The Philippines and Peru did not believe that the <span class=""highlight"">GEF</span> has been adequately restructured, especially with regard to universality of participation. While the Co-Chair implored delegates not to argue about restructuring, the US, France, Japan and Australia responded, since the issue of universality had been vigorously negotiated. Mauritius said restructuring was a precondition for the <span class=""highlight"">GEF</span> to be the interim, not the permanent, operating agency. The question before the Group is whether the interim arrangement is to be maintained. The question of a permanent <span class=""highlight"">financial mechanism</span> is rather premature. Benin noted that the fourth requirement in Article 11.3, determination of the amount of <span class=""highlight"">funding</span> necessary and available for the implementation of the Convention, is not settled."
funding|operating entity|gef|financial mechanism,"AGENDA ITEM 8(a)(i)  MODALITIES:   The Co-Chair initiated a discussion on possible arrangements between the COP and the <span class=""highlight"">operating entity</span> for the <span class=""highlight"">financial mechanism</span>, using the suggested elements in paragraph 11 of document A/AC.237/87. France, on behalf of the EU, supported using a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) as a form of institutional arrangement and agreed with the procedure for creating the agreement. She added that paragraphs 25 and 28 contained ambiguities, which must be clarified in the MOU, and that paragraph 19 must clarify how the COP can inform the <span class=""highlight"">GEF</span> or other organization on reconsideration of <span class=""highlight"">funding</span> decisions. The Co-Chair warned against micro- management of the <span class=""highlight"">operating entity</span>, but reiterated that any decision must be consistent with COP policies. Japan suggested deleting the list of specific articles from paragraph 31, on the mobilization of <span class=""highlight"">funds</span>. Co-Chair James Stovall opened the afternoon session by noting a general sense of agreement that the Secretariats of the Convention and the <span class=""highlight"">GEF</span> should draft an agreement."
funding|operating entity,"Sub-paragraph 1(a)(vii):   France suggested that this sub-paragraph, on mobilization of <span class=""highlight"">funds</span>, be deleted because the sub-paragraph requires the <span class=""highlight"">funding</span> mechanism to ensure predictability of resources, and shifts the commitment to ensure <span class=""highlight"">funds</span> onto the <span class=""highlight"">operating entity</span>. The US was concerned about linking several parts of the Convention without actually adding anything. Japan also had difficulty accepting this sub-paragraph. However, Egypt, India and the Philippines voiced strong objections. They noted the sub-paragraph only required the entity to take full account of the predictability of <span class=""highlight"">funds</span> in decision making, but did not require ensuring predictable <span class=""highlight"">funds</span>. China reminded delegates that this sub-paragraph added no new requirements and took two days of negotiation during INC-10. France and the Philippines disagreed as to the sub-paragraphs application to Article 4.3, developed States obligations. The US reiterated that the COP has responsibility for mobilizing <span class=""highlight"">funds</span>."
operating entity|gef|financial mechanism,"India proposed deleting sub-paragraph (ii) on information from multilateral and regional <span class=""highlight"">financial institutions</span>. The US wanted to retain it. Japan and Australia suggested deleting the underlined portions. On sub-paragraph (iv), China suggested retaining the first sentence on measures for promoting consistency, and deleting the rest. The US and Japan wanted to retain the entire paragraph. New Zealand proposed: The Secretariat and the <span class=""highlight"">operating entity</span> or entities of the <span class=""highlight"">financial mechanism</span> should promote consistency. Initial measures for promoting such consistency would include information collection and analysis, and appropriate contact with relevant institutions and organizations. India suggested deleting the entire paragraph since it micro- manages the <span class=""highlight"">GEF</span>."

Needs must be clearly defined in the plans designed by developing countries. Available <span class=""highlight"">funds</span> must first cover incremental costs, which should be determined jointly by the entity entrusted with <span class=""highlight"">financial mechanism</span> and the country concerned.

Annette des Iles (Trinidad and Tobago) introduced A/AC.237/L.23, the draft protocol submitted on behalf of AOSIS in September 1994, in accordance with Article 17 of the Convention. She noted that the protocol does not impose any additional obligations on developing country Parties. Its specific provisions include the following:The   Preamble   emphasizes that the burden of achieving the Conventions objectives rests with the developed States. In   Article 1   (Definitions) Sections (1), (7) and (8) differentiate between Parties to the Protocol and Parties to the Convention.   Article 2   (Basic Commitment) restates the core of the commitment contained in Article 4(1)(b) of the Convention.   Article 3   (Targets for greenhouse <span class=""highlight"">gas</span> reductions)is based on the Toronto target. It requires developed country Parties to the Protocol who are included in Annex I to reduce their <span class=""highlight"">CO2</span> <span class=""highlight"">emissions</span> by 2005 to a level at least 20% below that of 1990 and to establish timetables for controlling <span class=""highlight"">emissions</span> of other greenhouse <span class=""highlight"">gases</span>. Article 3(1)(b) requires that Annex I Parties adopt specific targets on other greenhouse <span class=""highlight"">gases</span>. Article 3(2)     (Review and revision of targets) authorizes the Meeting of the Parties to review and revise both the <span class=""highlight"">CO2</span> targets and timetable and the controls for other greenhouse <span class=""highlight"">gases</span>. Article 3(3) (Accession of non-Annex I Parties to the specific commitments) says the commitments are binding only on the Annex I Parties.   Article 4   (Coordination Mechanism) creates a subsidiary body to provide advice to the Meeting of the Parties.   Article 5   (Reporting Requirements) includes a new reporting requirement in Article 5(2) that Annex I Parties provide a cost/benefit analysis of measures undertaken.   Article 6   (Institutional Arrangements) uses institutions established under the Convention.   Article 7   (<span class=""highlight"">Technology</span> transfer) requires that the best available technologies...are expeditiously transferred to developing countries under fair and most favourable conditions.   Article 8   establishes a Meeting of the Parties with powers to review the Protocols implementation.   <span class=""highlight"">Article 9</span>   (Dispute settlement) states that disputes are to be settled in accordance with the Convention.

He said ambitious reduction targets for <span class=""highlight"">CO2</span> and other greenhouse <span class=""highlight"">gases</span>, such as <span class=""highlight"">methane</span> and N2 O, would make it possible to formulate clear political objectives. He suggested the broader application of economic instruments, increasing <span class=""highlight"">energy</span> efficiency, increased use of renewable <span class=""highlight"">energy</span> sources, the preservation, sustainable management and improvement of existing <span class=""highlight"">forests</span>, and <span class=""highlight"">afforestation</span>. He said a consensus was required at the COP on a commitment by Annex I Parties to stabilize their <span class=""highlight"">CO2</span> <span class=""highlight"">emissions</span>, individually or jointly, at <span class=""highlight"">1990 levels</span> by 2000."
transportation|transport,"AGENDA ITEM 5(c)  PHYSICAL <span class=""highlight"">LOCATION OF THE PERMANENT SECRETARIAT</span>:   The Chair reminded delegates that a contact group was established to advise the Committee on the location of the Secretariat. He then gave the floor to the representatives of the countries offering to host the Secretariat. The information about each offer is contained in A/AC.237/79/Add.4. Canada explained how Toronto is a leader in environmental protection and a multicultural city that is well suited to host the Secretariat. Germany outlined its proposal to host the Secretariat in Bonn, which has excellent communications and <span class=""highlight"">transportation</span> facilities and is a major academic, scientific and cultural center. Switzerland said that the choice for the Secretariats location should be based on effectiveness, not finance or prestige, and that Geneva, as a UN centre, would be the most effective. While Uruguay could not offer monetary subsidies or <span class=""highlight"">financial assistance</span> to developing countries, the low cost of living and services in Montevideo would amply offset the absence of generous subsidies. Kenya announced that it has withdrawn its offer to host the Secretariat. Further discussion will take place on Friday."
all gases|business,"AGENDA ITEM 7(b)  <span class=""highlight"">ADEQUACY OF COMMITMENTS</span>:   Following the introduction of the <span class=""highlight"">AOSIS protocol</span> and German elements paper in the Plenary, Working Group I resumed its discussion of Agenda Item 7(b), <span class=""highlight"">Adequacy of Commitments</span>. New Zealand, Hungary, France (on behalf of the EU), Japan, Canada, Denmark, Switzerland, Norway, the Netherlands, Australia, Belgium, Sweden and Mexico said commitments under Article 4.2(a) and (b) are not sufficient. New Zealand, supported by Japan, Switzerland, Norway, Australia and others, called for a <span class=""highlight"">consultative mechanism</span> to create a dialogue with <span class=""highlight"">business</span> interests. Saudi Arabia and Kuwait did not support this proposal since it would impose new conditionalities on developing countries. Hungary said that COP-1 should begin negotiations, and that Annex I countries could make commitments beyond 2000. France, on behalf of the EU, supported a comprehensive protocol on <span class=""highlight"">all GHGs</span>. He said that COP-1 must at least initiate negotiations on a protocol and that negotiations should occur in an _ad hoc_ working group. He also called for agreements on coordinated <span class=""highlight"">policies and measures</span> where competitiveness concerns exist. Japan said that there is an emerging consensus that a new international framework should be considered. He suggested completing protocol negotiations by COP-3, under the SBI. Switzerland said an _ad hoc_ working group should prepare a protocol for adoption by 1998. Norway said launching negotiations on new and <span class=""highlight"">binding commitments</span> should be COP-1s top priority."
new commitment|emission|eit|economies in transition,"The Russian Federation said it would be premature to take on <span class=""highlight"">new commitments</span>, and that the German proposal does not provide for countries with <span class=""highlight"">economies in transition</span>. The Netherlands said it is absolutely necessary to develop new agreements beyond 2000, and called for Annex I Parties to promise not to increase <span class=""highlight"">emissions</span> even if no agreement is in place. Australia said negotiations should take place in a body established under SBI authority and conclude by 1998 to leave time for ratification by 2000. Sweden suggested setting a joint target under which countries would reduce <span class=""highlight"">emissions</span> as a percentage of total global <span class=""highlight"">emissions</span>."
new commitment|differentiated responsibilities|emission|gas|uncertainties|scientific uncertainty,"The Philippines, on behalf of the G-77 and China, noted that one of the cardinal principles of the Convention is common but <span class=""highlight"">differentiated responsibilities</span>. He said that repair for damage to the environment should be borne by those principally responsible for the damage. Any attempt to reassign responsibilities could be interpreted as transferring the burden to the victims rather than the perpetrators of climate change. He added that the necessary improvements could be made at a more opportune time. Argentina, Fiji, Colombia, Mauritius, Chile, Malaysia and Bolivia supported the <span class=""highlight"">AOSIS protocol</span>, while expressing concern that Annex I Parties were not able to meet current commitments. Saudi Arabia and Kuwait urged caution in accepting <span class=""highlight"">new commitments</span>, given scientific <span class=""highlight"">uncertainty</span> and the inability of Annex I Parties to meet existing commitments. China said protocol negotiations were premature and noted that neither the best available <span class=""highlight"">scientific information</span> nor the national communications provided a sufficient basis for renegotiating. Germany reiterated the need for a protocol on greenhouse <span class=""highlight"">gas</span> reduction in all countries and a consensus at COP-1 by Annex I Parties to stabilize <span class=""highlight"">emissions</span> at 1990 level by the year 2000. The US highlighted the need for new aims, including a common menu of action, review of national communications by the SBSTA and strengthening the process of negotiations through the SBI to anchor the post-2000 era. France called for cost-benefit analysis of targets and timetables. Some developing countries, including Iran, Uganda, Kenya, Mali and Algeria, urged Annex I Parties to meet their commitments."
gef|financial mechanism,"AGENDA ITEM 8(b)  MAINTENANCE OF INTERIM FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS:   The afternoon session opened with a report from John Ashe (Antigua and Barbuda) on the results of the small working group addressing unresolved issues on the maintenance of interim arrangements. The group agreed on the following. The restructured <span class=""highlight"">GEF</span> shall continue, on an interim basis, to be the international entity entrusted with the operation of the <span class=""highlight"">financial mechanism</span> referred to in Article 11. In accordance with Article 11.4 of the Convention, the COP will review the <span class=""highlight"">financial mechanism</span> within four years and take appropriate measures, including a determination of the definitive status of the <span class=""highlight"">GEF</span> in the context of the Convention. The US accepted this, but reiterated that the text does not inspire confidence in the <span class=""highlight"">GEF</span>."
funding|technology|technology transfer|research and development,"Sub-paragraph 2(b):   France, supported by the US, suggested deleting this sub-paragraph, on assistance for research and <span class=""highlight"">development</span>, stating that the entity should <span class=""highlight"">fund</span> specific projects relevant to national programmes, not new or existing institutions. India, Benin, Brazil, China and Colombia stressed the need for including existing institutions and networking to facilitate <span class=""highlight"">technology</span> transfer. India agreed to limit the provision to existing institutions, but Sri Lanka and Kuwait commented that they have no existing institutions. The US voiced concern over the commercial connotation of research and <span class=""highlight"">development</span>. The Co-Chair recommended continuing this discussion on Thursday."
greenhouse gas emissions|emission|gas,"Paragraph 2(e):   Australia proposed maintaining this paragraph on supporting activities to mitigate <span class=""highlight"">greenhouse gas emissions. The EU proposed expanding the paragraph to provide greater detail about how the financial mechanism will support mitigation activities and will circulate its text.</span>"
emission|gas|private sector,"AGENDA ITEM 7(c)  <span class=""highlight"">JOINT IMPLEMENTATION</span>:   The Secretariat invited delegates to discuss A/AC.237/MISC.44 and A/AC.237/MISC.44/Add.1 on Criteria for <span class=""highlight"">Joint Implementation</span>. The US, supported by Japan, Australia and Canada, introduced draft language for a decision on <span class=""highlight"">Joint Implementation</span> (<span class=""highlight"">JI</span>) and an appendix on criteria. The draft decision establishes a <span class=""highlight"">pilot phase</span> for <span class=""highlight"">JI</span> beginning immediately after COP-1 and open to all Parties. Its objectives are to evaluate criteria, assess results, methodologies and accounting procedures, determine costs and benefits, assess institutional arrangements, identify problems, and encourage <span class=""highlight"">private sector</span> involvement. The SBSTA would develop monitoring and evaluation modalities and report to the SBI and the COP. The criteria include that <span class=""highlight"">JI</span> is voluntary, does not modify commitments, is financed outside existing <span class=""highlight"">ODA</span> or Annex II <span class=""highlight"">GEF</span> contributions, addresses any <span class=""highlight"">gases</span>, sources or <span class=""highlight"">sinks</span>, and includes data and methodological information to compare <span class=""highlight"">emissions</span> with and without the <span class=""highlight"">JI</span> measure. The US said <span class=""highlight"">JI</span> should be negotiated in tandem with the negotiation of new aims or strengthening of the Convention, because a <span class=""highlight"">JI</span> programme would benefit the Convention. France, on behalf of the EU, and supported by Australia, said that Annex I Parties should not use <span class=""highlight"">JI</span> to meet their present commitments. He called for additional clarification on expected benefits and risks through a <span class=""highlight"">pilot phase</span> under an agreed set of criteria, and promised draft language for a <span class=""highlight"">JI</span> programme."
baselines,"China said <span class=""highlight"">JI</span> means implementation of national policies between Annex I Parties and, thus, applies only to developed country Parties. If a developing country Party joins <span class=""highlight"">JI</span> in the <span class=""highlight"">pilot phase</span>, it should be on a voluntary basis and not shift developed country commitments onto developing country Parties. Due to its complexity, he said <span class=""highlight"">pilot phase</span> <span class=""highlight"">JI</span> credits, the system of accounting, and <span class=""highlight"">baselines</span> should be excluded from national inventories and used only as an exercise for accumulating experience. The Czech Republic said <span class=""highlight"">JI</span> projects should be based on appropriate bilateral or multilateral legal instruments."
financial mechanism|funding|private sector,"Saudi Arabia, supported by Kuwait, Iran and Nigeria, said that the <span class=""highlight"">pilot phase</span> of <span class=""highlight"">JI</span> should be limited to Annex I Parties and the experience gained from the <span class=""highlight"">pilot phase</span> could be used for the next phase. Chile supported <span class=""highlight"">JI</span> as a multilateral system with a monitoring mechanism and accepted the idea of a <span class=""highlight"">pilot phase</span> with a certain percentage of credits for developed and developing countries. While supporting <span class=""highlight"">JI</span>, South Africa suggested that the full implications of <span class=""highlight"">JI</span> is assessed for each country, total transparency is displayed in reporting and monitoring, any reductions under <span class=""highlight"">JI</span> by Annex I Parties are additional to their current commitments, and <span class=""highlight"">funding</span> under <span class=""highlight"">JI</span> is additional to the <span class=""highlight"">financial mechanism</span> of the Convention. The Russian Federation agreed on the broad involvement of the <span class=""highlight"">private sector</span>, with national review of <span class=""highlight"">JI</span> projects. Costa Rica supported limits on Annex I Parties in <span class=""highlight"">JI</span> and hoped that COP-1 would arrive at a decision to launch a <span class=""highlight"">pilot phase</span>. Argentina, supported by Mauritius, preferred a <span class=""highlight"">pilot phase</span> without a credit system so that trust could be built among partners in the Convention. Argentina added that <span class=""highlight"">JI</span> activities should be developed in accordance with national and sustainable <span class=""highlight"">development</span> priorities. The Philippines said that it was clear that several G-77 members were expressing their views as <span class=""highlight"">sovereign</span> Parties to the Convention and that their statements did not reflect the complete or common position of the G-77 and China. He noted that <span class=""highlight"">JI</span> should not allow for the shifting of specific commitments of Annex I Parties to developing countries. He added that there was a plethora of interesting, but still divergent interests on this matter and efforts were underway to produce language that expressed unity of intention despite diversity of opinion."
montreal protocol|emission|greenhouse gas emissions|gas|sink,"Paragraph 2(e):   The G-77 and the US insisted that there should be a link between paragraphs 2(d) and 2(e). The G-77, supported by the US and Australia, proposed deleting the bracketed phrase in paragraph 1(a)(v), if 2(e) remains in the text. Otherwise, the G-77 felt that 2(e) should be deleted. The EU disagreed. There were also questions about whether the comprehensive approach to mitigation described in the Convention focuses only on <span class=""highlight"">emissions</span> sources or on <span class=""highlight"">sinks</span> as well. The Chair indicated that the main objective of this paragraph is that activities to mitigate greenhouse <span class=""highlight"">gas</span> <span class=""highlight"">emissions</span> should get priority in <span class=""highlight"">GEF</span> financing. The EU preferred retaining reference to the comprehensive approach, and added that its deletion would require explicit listing of the sectors in which mitigation activities must be carried out. Developing countries held that the first part of the paragraph referenced only mitigation of <span class=""highlight"">emissions</span> and additional terms would alter the focus. The Co-Chair proposed the following: In the implementation of these national programmes, the <span class=""highlight"">operating entity</span> or entities should support activities to mitigate greenhouse <span class=""highlight"">gas</span> <span class=""highlight"">emissions</span> not controlled by the <span class=""highlight"">Montreal Protocol</span>, [and to protect and enhance <span class=""highlight"">sinks</span> and reservoirs of greenhouse <span class=""highlight"">gases</span>/consistent with the comprehensive approach contained in the convention]."
technology|technology transfer,"AGENDA ITEM 9  PROVISION TO DEVELOPING COUNTRY PARTIES OF TECHNICAL AND <span class=""highlight"">FINANCIAL SUPPORT</span>:   Janos Pasztor from the Interim Secretariat presented documents A/AC.237/90 and the addenda, which contained progress reports on the Climate Convention information exchange programme (CC:INFO), the joint training programme (CC:TRAIN), and a note on the Climate Convention cooperation programme (CC:COPE). Antigua and Barbuda, referring to A/AC.237/ 90/Add.3 on assistance for enabling activities, asked about the role of the informal <span class=""highlight"">consultative mechanism</span> and whether it involves <span class=""highlight"">technology</span> transfer. The Interim Secretariat replied that the <span class=""highlight"">consultative mechanism</span> is intended as a sharing process, and that <span class=""highlight"">technology</span> transfer has not been discussed. Antigua and Barbuda also asked whether paragraph 39(a), on enabling countries to produce better project proposals, was intended to help develop proposals, or merely to share information. The <span class=""highlight"">GEF</span> said that the mechanism was under the guidance of the Interim Secretariat."
gef|financial mechanism,"The US commented that document A/AC.237/80 contains the inputs for the CC programmes and asked for estimates on the outputs. The Interim Secretariat will prepare a table for discussion next week. Poland and the Russian Federation expressed concern about the availability of <span class=""highlight"">GEF</span> financing within the <span class=""highlight"">financial mechanism</span> and said it should not be limited to developing countries. The <span class=""highlight"">GEF</span> replied that this document only covers enabling activities within the <span class=""highlight"">financial mechanism</span> and that activities within CC:COPE are not limited to developing countries. Algeria said that agreement must be reached on an approach that will define the framework of assistance to be given to developing countries, adding that the COP alone is empowered to define eligibility criteria. The <span class=""highlight"">GEF</span> responded that the operational criteria defined in paragraph 18 of the document are not eligibility criteria but rather internal operating matters for the <span class=""highlight"">GEF</span>."
funding|gef,"AGENDA ITEM 8(a)(ii)  MODALITIES:   The Chair said that more discussion is needed on the assessment of <span class=""highlight"">funding</span> needs and the form of the arrangement. During INC-10, there was a choice between an MOU and a legally- binding agreement, and most Parties, if not all, expressed support for the MOU. The Philippines noted that the G-77 and China have not yet come up with a definite decision on this matter or on the assessment of <span class=""highlight"">funding</span> needs. Colombia said that the COP should begin to work on the MOU before the Secretariat of the Convention begins its talks with the <span class=""highlight"">GEF</span>. The US responded that since the Secretariat has produced a good text in A/AC.237/87, the Committee could recommend that the two secretariats meet and develop an MOU in time for COP-1. Discussion will resume on both agenda items on Tuesday morning."
baselines|funding,"As the debate on <span class=""highlight"">Joint Implementation</span> (<span class=""highlight"">JI</span>) heats up, divisions between developing countries based on divergent interests and priorities are becoming apparent. It is clear from Article 4(2)(a) of the Convention that <span class=""highlight"">JI</span> can take place between Annex I Parties. Discussion on broadening <span class=""highlight"">JI</span> to include developing countries was first initiated at INC-8, raising developing countries' concerns about its potential implications and impacts. Developing countries have viewed <span class=""highlight"">JI</span> with varying degrees of skepticism and caution. Concerns have once again been expressed that Annex I Parties should not use <span class=""highlight"">JI</span> as a means to avoid meeting their current commitments under the Convention and that <span class=""highlight"">JI</span> agreements should not substitute for <span class=""highlight"">funding</span> mechanisms under the Convention. However, the position of some developing countries appears to be changing. There are those who favor limiting the <span class=""highlight"">JI</span> <span class=""highlight"">pilot phase</span> only to Annex I Parties and others who are more amenable to the voluntary and equitable participation of developing countries. There appears to be some agreement among developing countries that the thorny problem of the allotment of greenhouse <span class=""highlight"">gas</span> abatement credits and a <span class=""highlight"">baseline</span> be excluded from the <span class=""highlight"">pilot phase</span>."
funding,"AGENDA ITEM 10 -- REVIEW OF ACTIVITIES OF THE INTERIM SECRETARIAT:   The Interim Secretariat introduced document A/AC.237/80, a review of Secretariat activities and extrabudgetary <span class=""highlight"">funds</span>. He explained the geographic diversity of the staff, estimates for <span class=""highlight"">funding</span> needs and contributions to the Special Voluntary <span class=""highlight"">Fund</span>. The EU, supported by Germany, Switzerland and Canada, proposed a working group to address budgetary matters and asked that it review the 1995 and 1996/97 budgets."
private sector|technology transfer,"AGENDA ITEM 7(c)  <span class=""highlight"">JOINT IMPLEMENTATION</span>:   The Netherlands noted its experimental <span class=""highlight"">joint implementation</span> (<span class=""highlight"">JI</span>) programme and expressed regret that <span class=""highlight"">JI</span> projects initiated prior to the <span class=""highlight"">pilot phase</span> may not be credited. Kenya suggested that the COP should establish a <span class=""highlight"">clearinghouse</span> for <span class=""highlight"">transfer of technologies</span> employed in the <span class=""highlight"">JI</span> <span class=""highlight"">pilot phase</span>, so that developing country participants are not left at the mercy of the <span class=""highlight"">private sector</span>. The Chair proposed establishing a contact group to resolve differences."
intergovernmental panel on climate change,"AGENDA ITEM 7(e)  SUBSIDIARY BODIES:   The Secretariat presented document A/AC.237/85 on the roles of the subsidiary bodies. France, on behalf of the EU, supported by Canada and others, endorsed the SBSTAs two technical advisory panels. The EU added that the review of <span class=""highlight"">adequacy of commitments</span> should be given to an _ad hoc_ committee. The US thought this was the SBIs responsibility. Australia said that both bodies are the engine of the COP and the Convention, and added that an _ad hoc _committee under SBI review the <span class=""highlight"">adequacy of commitments</span>. Benin pointed out that periodic reports on the implementation of the Convention had not been included. Japan called for limiting the number of working languages. New Zealand said that the SBSTA should serve as the link between <span class=""highlight"">IPCC</span> and the COP, and the negotiation of any new instrument strengthening the Convention should be under the SBI. The US called for a clear division of responsibilities with the SBSTA offering guidelines used to produce national communications, and the SBI evaluating the synthesis report based on measures and policies from national communications. The US also stressed the need for maintaining the intellectual objectivity of the <span class=""highlight"">IPCC</span>. The Philippines, on behalf of G-77 and China, said that the SBSTA should not be subordinated to the SBI as if they were parallel bodies, and added that the SBSTA should work out guidelines for the <span class=""highlight"">IPCC</span> report. China said that given the importance of both bodies, all six UN working languages were required. Malawi said that the <span class=""highlight"">IPCC</span> should not be subordinated to the SBSTA."
intergovernmental panel on climate change,"The US, supported by the EU, the Netherlands, Japan, Canada and Australia, said it was concerned about the form and nature of the simplification, who would simplify the guidelines, how transparency would be maintained, and what revising the guidelines might cost. China responded that the G-77 and China would revise the guidelines, that transparency was a relative term in light of some Annex 1 communications, and that simplified guidelines would cost less to apply than scholastic, bombastic and complicated forms from the existing guidelines. France, on behalf of the EU, said simplified leaves a broad scope for interpretation, and suggested that developing countries could use <span class=""highlight"">IPCC</span> default guidelines. The Chair asked if China would accept adding defaults, but China reiterated that the <span class=""highlight"">IPCC</span> guidelines are too cumbersome. As a compromise, the Chair suggested amending the text to read that non-Annex I Parties could use <span class=""highlight"">IPCC</span> guidelines or the simplified default methodologies adopted by the <span class=""highlight"">IPCC</span> and leave the original text to read as appropriate and to the extent possible. China said the <span class=""highlight"">IPCC</span> should not give instructions on reporting to <span class=""highlight"">sovereign</span> States, but agreed to accept the Chairs suggestion."
gas|gasâ­by-gas,"The EU suggested adding language to paragraph 1(c) to read provided that the inventories are compiled on a fully disaggregated and detailed <span class=""highlight"">gas</span>-by-<span class=""highlight"">gas</span> basis and that the methodologies and calculations are transparent, and on a provisional basis so that new <span class=""highlight"">IPCC</span> methodologies could be added in the future. China said the amendment sounded like bombs to developing countries. France said the language could be amended to refer to previous decisions of the INC on guidelines, inventories and national communications. China accepted taking account the decisions of the INC and the paragraph was adopted."
article 9,"In sub-paragraph 1(d)(ii), the EU added that the SBSTA provide advice to the COP and the SBI. China said that under the Convention both the SBSTA and SBI are parallel organizations and suggested that SBSTA provide advice to the COP and not the SBI. The UK agreed that the bodies are parallel, but that <span class=""highlight"">Article 9</span> of the Convention states that the SBSTA was established to provide advice to the COP and, as appropriate, its other subsidiary bodies."
bunker fuels,"In sub-paragraph 1(d)(iv) on a work plan and timetable on the allocation and control of <span class=""highlight"">emissions</span> from international <span class=""highlight"">bunker fuels</span>, the EU added a new sub- paragraph that the SBSTA, with the guidance of SBI, take into account ongoing work in governments and IGOs. In Paragraph 2 on the contribution of relevant organizations, including the <span class=""highlight"">IPCC</span> to the work of the SBSTA, the EU suggested adding scientific aspects of before methodologies. The Working Group then informally accepted the text. The G-77 and China asked for time to review the _deja vu_ document and the Working Group was adjourned."
funding|financial resources|gef,"The Co-Chair of Working Group II reported that the Group had covered all items, but must make major progress if the Group plans to have recommendations for COP-I. He reported the following: 1) Interim Arrangements  the Group agreed that the <span class=""highlight"">GEF</span> will remain the operating mechanism on an interim basis and will be reviewed within four years; 2) Modalities has four major sub-topics. On the format of the agreement, the Parties said they would need to know content before making a final decision. On the content, the Parties have generally agreed with the Secretariats suggestions. On the assessment of <span class=""highlight"">funding</span> needs, the Group has not reached agreement. On the process of interim arrangements, the Group endorsed continuing consultation between the Interim Secretariat and the <span class=""highlight"">GEF</span> Secretariat to draft an arrangement; 3) Policy Guidance  the Co-Chair said his current text indicates areas of disagreement with bracketed text; and 4) Technical and <span class=""highlight"">Financial Support</span> for Developing Countries  the Group has agreed on some areas and will continue its discussion on Tuesday."
funding,"The Chair then opened the floor for comments. The EU and the US supported Annex I and specifically noted paragraph 6, which requires the adoption of the budget by consensus, and suggested that the scale of contributions mentioned in paragraph 9 be more explicit. The EU noted that many provisions common to environmental agreements are not included here, such as a requirement for consensus for amendments to <span class=""highlight"">financial rules</span>, and a provision for reallocating the balance of assets should a <span class=""highlight"">fund</span> be dissolved. The EU also stated that these budgetary matters cannot be properly considered in Plenary, and recommended establishing an open-ended group to consider Annex I. The US and Australia supported the need for a reserve <span class=""highlight"">fund</span>, but Japan and the Russian Federation expressed concern over the amount."
energy,"The Interim Secretariat introduced document A/AC.237/79/Add.3, on the budget outline for the Permanent Secretariat, and noted that it is still unclear exactly what is expected of the Secretariat and how much governments are prepared to pay for it. He explained that unlike other convention secretariats, this Secretariat will deal with global <span class=""highlight"">energy</span> use, which is much broader than the scope of CITES or the <span class=""highlight"">Montreal Protocol</span>, and comparisons to the secretariats for international policy reviews, such as the OECD or the trade policy mechanism under GATT, were more accurate."
funding,"The EU expressed the need for a more detailed budget, and noted that the composition of the ACABQ did not coincide with the Parties to the Convention. The Interim Secretariat replied that the ACABQ, a standing body, was only included to alleviate concerns about the new Secretariat and that more guidance was needed from the Parties before they could develop a detailed budget. Benin asked about staff recruitment and the voluntary <span class=""highlight"">fund</span>. The Secretariat responded that staff size will depend on the size of the COP, and that the voluntary <span class=""highlight"">fund</span> is entirely dependent upon contributions."
intergovernmental panel on climate change,"The Philippines suggested combining the second and third bullets of Appendix 1 to read, On behalf of the Conference of Parties request climate change related scientific research from competent international bodies, including _inter alia_, <span class=""highlight"">IPCC</span>; compile and synthesize scientific and technical information on the global situation in climate change. The US asked whether it was intended to leave out the latest developments in science, to the extent possible, and assess the implications thereof. The Philippines said implications were covered by references to assessments elsewhere in the draft. Uruguay objected since the amendment questioned the role of the <span class=""highlight"">IPCC</span> by giving other organizations comparable status. The Chair suggested inserting Under the guidance of the COP at the beginning of the section, rather than in the bullet. The Philippines agreed to retain the deleted phrases. Switzerland objected to using new language in climate change related scientific research information. The Chairs recommendation to combine bullets 2 and 3 and add the word socioeconomic was accepted. Saudi Arabia asked that socioeconomic be added wherever scientific and technical appear in the draft."
intergovernmental panel on climate change|uncertainties,"In Appendix II, the G-77 and China added a paragraph before the existing (a) to read: Stress to the <span class=""highlight"">IPCC</span> the importance of completing its <span class=""highlight"">second assessment report</span>, which is expected to address, on a scientific basis, both certainties and <span class=""highlight"">uncertainties</span> regarding the causes, effects, magnitudes, and timing of climate change, in conformity with Article 4.1(g). The US suggested the recommendation would be better oriented toward the COP. The EU questioned whether the paragraph would give improper political advice to the <span class=""highlight"">IPCC</span>. Uruguay said the proposal emphasized the scientific nature of the <span class=""highlight"">IPCC</span>, but that the authority of subsidiary bodies over the <span class=""highlight"">IPCC</span> needed to be clear. The Netherlands said the <span class=""highlight"">IPCC</span> should remain independent and not receive instructions from the COP. China said the Conventions existence changes the <span class=""highlight"">IPCC</span>, and the <span class=""highlight"">IPCC</span> has to respond to requests from the Secretariat."
funding|business,"In Appendix III, the US added intergovernmental to the table wherever technical advisory panels appears. He also suggested adding a paragraph in Appendix II, section 1(e) to hold a workshop, which would be open to all Parties and interested non-governmental participants, on non-governmental advisory committees and/or a <span class=""highlight"">business</span> <span class=""highlight"">consultative mechanism</span> in the January 1996 session of SBSTA. The Philippines and China noted that developing countries would need <span class=""highlight"">funding</span> to attend."
co2,"After another break, delegates continued their review of communications from Annex I Parties at 7:00 pm. In 1(a), the EU said <span class=""highlight"">flexibility</span> was possible on the date of the second national communication but preferred not to set a precedent. Hungary inserted revised before guidelines and added in paragraph 5 with a view to enhancing the comparability and focus of communications, which was amended further by the Netherlands. The US suggestion with guidelines, revised as appropriate was accepted. In 1(b), the EU added a reference to annual inventories, particularly on <span class=""highlight"">CO2</span>. Uruguay suggested submission of annual reports after 1997. Canada supported the existing text. The US, supported by the UK, asked whether it was possible to have a single submission for inventory and communication reporting. Argentina added reference to Annex I Parties that have not submitted communications. In paragraph 7, the EUs reference to collaboration between the Secretariat, non- Annex I Parties, the <span class=""highlight"">GEF</span> and the subsidiary bodies was rejected by the US. The G-77 and China needed time to consult on paragraphs 7 and 8. In paragraph 9, the US questioned the financial implications of transmission and distribution of communications and preferred a more general reference. Discussions were expected to continue."
gef|financial mechanism,"AGENDA ITEM 8(b)  MAINTENANCE OF INTERIM ARRANGEMENTS FOR THE <span class=""highlight"">FINANCIAL MECHANISM</span>:   Delegates adopted A/AC.237/WG.II/L.9, a draft decision submitted by the Co-Chairs to maintain interim arrangements with the <span class=""highlight"">GEF</span>."
transport|agriculture|technology|industry|technology transfer,"<span class=""highlight"">TECHNOLOGY</span> TRANSFER:   The Co-Chair then invited comments on A/AC.237/Misc.41. The G-77, supported by China, Colombia and Algeria, stated that the idea is to enable developing countries, not to provide <span class=""highlight"">technology</span> alone. Colombia commented that this issue was a problem for other conventions, none of which have agreed on the means of implementation. China suggested that the Secretariat develop an inventory of <span class=""highlight"">technology</span> transferable at no cost, and Algeria requested that the Secretariat develop practical means for implementing <span class=""highlight"">technology</span> transfer for COP-1. The EU stated that institutional capacity building in developing countries is crucial, and that <span class=""highlight"">technology</span> transfer efforts should concentrate on <span class=""highlight"">industry</span>, <span class=""highlight"">agriculture</span> and <span class=""highlight"">transport</span> sectors. WWF stressed that new initiatives should not substitute for action in the industrialized countries and the need for clear strategies."

France, on behalf of the EU, suggested that UNEP and UNITAR administer and <span class=""highlight"">fund</span> the programmes with oversight by the Secretariat. UNEP commented it could not <span class=""highlight"">fund</span> these programmes under its current budget. The Philippines, on behalf of the G-77, stressed the importance of these programmes in the success of the Convention.

The EU, Japan and Australia expressed doubts about bringing this matter before the ACABQ. Australia and New Zealand supported setting aside Secretariat <span class=""highlight"">funds</span> for the <span class=""highlight"">IPCC</span>. The Executive Secretary said that consultations are underway on the type of services the <span class=""highlight"">IPCC</span> is expected to deliver and that the Secretariat would possibly contribute 10-15% of the <span class=""highlight"">IPCC</span> budget."

China said that Annex I Parties have yet to fulfill their current commitments and thus the Group could not consider the Co-Chairs draft proposal. The EU wanted to discuss the draft text while Kuwait wanted to bracket it. Iran said that the different views should be reflected. The US suggested amending the title to read Review of the adequacy of Article 4.2(a) and (b). In the Preamble, on the tasks of the subsidiary bodies, Iran, Uruguay and India suggested deleting references to the <span class=""highlight"">IPCC</span> Chairs statement and the annotated literature. Canada wanted to retain the references, but they were deleted. Malaysia, supported by the EU, proposed an amendment recognizing that the commitments of Annex I Parties under Article 4.2(a) and (b) are inadequate, which Kuwait opposed. Switzerland suggested a reference to the 1994 <span class=""highlight"">IPCC</span> Special Reports conclusion that the <span class=""highlight"">stabilization</span> of <span class=""highlight"">CO2</span> <span class=""highlight"">emissions</span> at <span class=""highlight"">1990 levels</span> will not lead to <span class=""highlight"">stabilization</span> at any time during the next two centuries. Australia added that the commitments do not deal with the post-2000 period and apply only to Annex I Parties, but Malaysia, Brazil, Argentina, US, the EU and Nauru disagreed."
business,"China, supported by Iran, Uganda and Kuwait, said paragraph 1(c), urging Parties to contribute to the process, should be deleted because it referred to an undefined process in paragraph 1(b). China, Brazil and Malaysia wanted to delete paragraph 1(d), establishing a <span class=""highlight"">consultative mechanism</span> with international <span class=""highlight"">business</span>, because it is beyond the intergovernmental scope of the Convention. The US and New Zealand supported retaining the paragraph. The Netherlands suggested consider ways to improve communication between the Convention bodies and the <span class=""highlight"">business</span> community. Kenya said 1(d) was not related to adequacy. The Chair said the question would be placed into ongoing consultations on linkages between subsidiary bodies and the outside community."
greenhouse gas emissions|emission|gas,"Paragraph 4, on national policies and mitigation measures applicable only to Annex I Parties, was retained as paragraph 3 of the G-77 proposal. Paragraph 4 of the G-77 proposal emphasizes that according to the Convention, only Annex I Parties have obligations to limit <span class=""highlight"">greenhouse gas emissions and developing countries have no such obligation, and footnotes preambular paragraph 3 of the Convention. The US amended the paragraph and added a reference to Article 4.2(b) in place of greenhouse gas emissions. The G-77 and China objected. The Co-Chair said that both amendments will be reflected but the US preferred bracketing the G-77 text. The Chair cautioned that brackets be used only as a last option. Australia suggested referring to the provisions of Article 4.2(a). Norway also reserved on the G-77 text. Senegal asked how progress could be made with everything pending.</span>"

Venezuela commented that this proposal had been submitted during informal consultations, but the Bureau rejected it without legal authority. The Chair said the rules have been discussed at length for more than two years and that the Bureau's mandate allowed limiting the options so that the Plenary could complete its work. Saudi Arabia, Iran, Kuwait, Indonesia, Algeria and Nigeria said that the issue had not been discussed thoroughly and wanted the proposal included in brackets."

emission|gas|intergovernmental panel on climate change,"Increasing scientific evidence about the possibility of global climate change in the 1980s led to a growing awareness that human activities have been contributing to substantial increases in the atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse <span class=""highlight"">gases</span>. Concerned that anthropogenic increases of <span class=""highlight"">emissions</span> enhance the natural greenhouse effect and would result, on average, in an additional warming of the Earth's surface, the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) and the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) established the <span class=""highlight"">Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change</span> (<span class=""highlight"">IPCC</span>) in 1988. The Panel focused on: assessing <span class=""highlight"">scientific information</span> related to the various aspects of climate change; evaluating the environmental and socio-<span class=""highlight"">economic impacts</span> of climate change; and formulating response strategies for the management of global climate change. In 1990, the finalization and adoption of the <span class=""highlight"">IPCC</span> report and the Second World Climate Conference focused further attention on climate change."

Supported by UNEP and WMO, the mandate of the INC/FCCC was to prepare an effective framework convention on climate change. The INC held five sessions between February 1991 and May 1992. During these meetings, participants from over 150 states discussed the difficult and contentious issues of <span class=""highlight"">binding commitments</span>, targets and timetables for the reduction of <span class=""highlight"">carbon dioxide</span> <span class=""highlight"">emissions</span>, <span class=""highlight"">financial mechanisms</span>, <span class=""highlight"">technology</span> transfer, and common but <span class=""highlight"">differentiated responsibilities</span> of developed and developing countries. The INC sought to achieve a consensus that could be supported by a broad majority, rather than drafting a treaty that dealt with specific policies that might limit participation."

During these INC sessions, scientific work was done to improve the methodologies for measuring <span class=""highlight"">emissions</span> from various sources, but the larger scientific problem is choosing the best methodology to estimate the removal of <span class=""highlight"">carbon dioxide</span> by <span class=""highlight"">sinks</span>, namely <span class=""highlight"">oceans</span> and <span class=""highlight"">forests</span>. The other major task before negotiators has been to work on the difficult issue of <span class=""highlight"">financial support</span> for implementation, particularly for developing country Parties who will require new and additional resources to obtain data and implement <span class=""highlight"">energy</span>-efficient technologies and other necessary measures."

In discussions on matters relating to commitments, delegates examined methodologies for calculations/inventories of <span class=""highlight"">emissions</span> and removal of greenhouse <span class=""highlight"">gases</span>, the first review of information communicated by Annex I Parties, the role of the subsidiary bodies established by the Convention, and criteria for <span class=""highlight"">joint implementation</span>. Delegates also reviewed the <span class=""highlight"">adequacy of commitments</span>. The need for broader action beyond the year 2000 on the commitments in Article 4.2(a) and (b) was considered, based on the understanding that the provisions of this article refer to the present decade."

On agreed full incremental costs, the Committee concluded that this issue was complex and that further discussions were needed. Delegates also concluded that the concept should be flexible and applied on a case-by-case basis. The Interim Secretariat was requested to prepare a paper on <span class=""highlight"">transfer of technology and delegations were invited to submit their views on this issue. On the subject of the Subsidiary Body for Scientific and Technological Advice (SBSTA) and the Subsidiary Body for Implementation (SBI), the provisional recommendation to the COP is that the SBSTA will be the link between the scientific and technical assessments and the information provided by international bodies and the policy-oriented needs of the COP.

While delegates did agree to maintain the <span class=""highlight"">GEF</span> as the interim entity operating the <span class=""highlight"">financial mechanism</span> and to finance mitigation activities, little concrete progress was made on other important issues before the Committee. Delegates were unable to take action on the <span class=""highlight"">adequacy of commitments</span> or to begin negotiations on a draft protocol submitted by AOSIS or the proposals for further elements of a protocol submitted by Germany. There was no progress on <span class=""highlight"">joint implementation</span>.

He noted the complex role of aerosols, which diminish or mask greenhouse warming in the short term, but whose temporary protection could be lost quickly if their <span class=""highlight"">emissions</span> are reduced. Because of the time lag between <span class=""highlight"">emissions</span> and global temperature increase and the delay in social and economic response, there is a hidden threat. <span class=""highlight"">Uncertainty</span> in model predictions does not decrease risk, but simply makes the risk more difficult to pinpoint. The threat from rising sea levels may not be as great as that of increasing <span class=""highlight"">vulnerability</span> in <span class=""highlight"">coastal</span> areas due to possible <span class=""highlight"">storm</span> effects related to global warming."

He said the AOSIS States proposed the draft protocol because they are being hit first and hardest by climate change that they are not responsible for, adding that continuing <span class=""highlight"">emissions</span> at present levels would be a <span class=""highlight"">disaster</span> for all. He termed the 20% <span class=""highlight"">emissions</span> reduction by developed countries in the <span class=""highlight"">AOSIS protocol</span> a small but necessary first step toward the 60-80% reduction scientists say is necessary for <span class=""highlight"">stabilization</span> of atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse <span class=""highlight"">gases</span>. Postponing this decision would require larger and more difficult cuts, while an early decision will prevent countries from facing an unacceptable choice between a ruined economy and a ruined climate.

India   endorsed the G-77 and Chinas statement and expressed concern about certain parts of the <span class=""highlight"">AOSIS proposal</span>. He stressed the need for a protocol that imposes stringent commitments only on Annex I Parties.   The Russian Federation   noted that decreasing <span class=""highlight"">energy</span> production alone may not accomplish the Conventions goals but will cause economic hardship. He stated that the <span class=""highlight"">AOSIS proposal</span> lacks significant scientific basis, and he stressed the importance of the second <span class=""highlight"">IPCC</span> report."

Canada   asked Prof. Bolin if sulfate <span class=""highlight"">emissions</span> should be reduced because aerosols produce a cooling effect. Bolin warned against attempts to balance different <span class=""highlight"">emissions</span>.   Austria   asked Bolin if reducing present <span class=""highlight"">emissions</span> was preferable to later reductions since technological advances will likely allow easier reductions in the future. Bolin replied that innovations are not guaranteed and measures should not be postponed."
sea level rise,"Brazil   said delegates should not prejudge the mechanisms for perfecting implementation of the Convention, which could include the drafting of a new instrument, a protocol, other measures and means, timetables and targets, or some combination of these. He said developing countries right to <span class=""highlight"">development</span> should not be compromised, and that trying to enroll developing countries in a hasty manner or by making linkages with <span class=""highlight"">joint implementation</span> would not solve any problems.   Antigua and Barbuda   said island States view <span class=""highlight"">sea level</span> rise as the primary threat. The <span class=""highlight"">AOSIS protocol</span> takes a universal view rather than narrowly confining its approach to the views of those living on large continental shelves."

Hungary   said negotiations on further measures should begin as soon as possible, with COP-1 deciding on a mandate for negotiations based on the EUs proposal.   Germany   said a commitment to at least keep <span class=""highlight"">emissions</span> at <span class=""highlight"">1990 levels</span> after 2000 is a necessary step irrespective of other action on reductions. An immediate framework for reductions is an urgent requirement. Delegates should adopt a clear mandate as a starting point for protocol negotiations.

Sectoral policies on efficient uses of <span class=""highlight"">energy</span> and those favoring sustainable <span class=""highlight"">development</span> should also be considered. He said that <span class=""highlight"">new commitments</span> should be assumed by developed countries and the protocol should include <span class=""highlight"">all GHGs</span> as well as ways to strengthen the information and assessment machinery.   Australia   expressed surprise about comments that it is blocking progress and noted its long-standing track record as an active, committed participant in these negotiations. She called for COP-1 to produce clear guidelines on the negotiations of a protocol. The protocol must not limit action to one group of countries, but should involve action by all Parties within the principle of common but <span class=""highlight"">differentiated responsibilities</span>."

China cannot accept the creation of new categories of countries and thought it inappropriate for developing county Parties to undertake <span class=""highlight"">new commitments</span>.   Colombia   shared the view that the commitments are inadequate because they do not lead to <span class=""highlight"">stabilization</span> and they do not specify targets beyond 2000.

The mandate should include: work towards a protocol under the SBI with a <span class=""highlight"">legally-binding instrument</span> in 1997; the inclusion of <span class=""highlight"">all GHGs</span>; action for the post-2000 period; a lead taken by developed countries with reduction efforts by those developing countries contributing most to <span class=""highlight"">emissions</span>; and the creation of a <span class=""highlight"">business</span> <span class=""highlight"">consultative mechanism</span>.   Saudi Arabia   said that although its approach and concerns are different, it is not blocking progress. Saudi Arabia is concerned that it would be affected economically by the different measures to reduce <span class=""highlight"">consumption</span> of <span class=""highlight"">fossil fuels</span>, particularly <span class=""highlight"">oil</span>. He said that the COP should not take hasty steps, but should wait until the IPCCs <span class=""highlight"">second assessment report</span> is released."
emission|co2,"Bangladesh   shared the concerns expressed by the G-77 and China, Samoa and Fiji. He said there must be a definite commitment to reduce <span class=""highlight"">CO2</span> <span class=""highlight"">emissions</span> beyond 2000 and any country that exceeds the identified standard should be subject to some form of <span class=""highlight"">emissions</span> tax."
technology transfer|technology,"The Republic of Korea   said that the principal responsibility for <span class=""highlight"">reduction of emissions resides with developed countries who have not met current commitments. Additionally, the socio-economic conditions of most developing countries does not allow them to concentrate on climate change. He supported the draft AOSIS protocol.   Mauritania   said that Africa was most adversely affected by climate change. It was clear that the replenishment of the interim financial mechanism and transfer of technology require new impetus since these are critical for developing countries. A universal negotiation process should be established within the COP and not in a subsidiary body.</span>"
emissions scenarios|technology transfer|technology,"Kuwait   said that information presented by Bolin was not reflected by prior speakers. Quoting from the Report of IPCCs Working Group III, he said that <span class=""highlight"">emissions</span> <span class=""highlight"">scenarios</span> are not appropriate inputs to negotiation of possible <span class=""highlight"">emission</span> reductions. He agreed that it was premature to engage in protocol drafting exercises since Annex I Parties have not met current commitments.   Iran   agreed that full implementation of commitments by Annex I Parties must be the first priority. A decision on <span class=""highlight"">inadequacy of commitments</span> should wait until the release of the IPCCs <span class=""highlight"">second assessment report</span>. Discussion on commitments should also include financial commitments and <span class=""highlight"">transfer of technology.</span>"

fossil fuels|fuel|reducing emissions|emission|co2,"UNDP:   Administrator James Gustave Speth called for the immediate negotiation of a protocol to reduce <span class=""highlight"">CO2</span> <span class=""highlight"">emissions</span>. The necessary <span class=""highlight"">fossil fuel emission reductions</span> are achievable if the appropriate technologies are disseminated. UNDP will support developing countries in getting these technologies."
funding|eit|economies in transition,"South Africa:   Dr. F. Hanekom said that although a national monitoring system and database exist, foreign <span class=""highlight"">funding</span> will allow South Africa to establish a national monitoring center for GHGs that would benefit the entire region.   Ukraine:   Yuriy I. Kostenko, Minister for Environmental Protection and <span class=""highlight"">Nuclear</span> Safety, highlighted the difficulties in the countries with <span class=""highlight"">economies in transition</span>. The Ukraine will ratify the Convention when it is able to implement its provisions."
ecosystem|ocean|energy efficiency|energy|industry,"UNIDO:   Ms. A. Tcheknavorian-Asenbauer said <span class=""highlight"">industries</span> in developing countries must be helped to improve competitiveness through <span class=""highlight"">energy</span> efficiency, an area where UNIDO can help.   UNESCO:   Gisbert Glaser noted that the objectives of the Convention cannot be achieved without science, <span class=""highlight"">education</span>, internationally coordinated research and global monitoring efforts. UNESCO can contribute through its programmes on <span class=""highlight"">oceans</span>, the earth crust, <span class=""highlight"">ecosystems</span> and freshwater resources."
desertification,"IOC:   Dr. Gunnar Kullenberg identified the need to improve knowledge of the role of the <span class=""highlight"">oceans</span> in climate change. There are specific areas in the marine environment that need evaluation, including marshes, mangroves, wetlands, shelves, estuaries and coral reefs.   Convention to Combat <span class=""highlight"">Desertification</span>:   Executive- Secretary Hama Arba Diallo noted that 103 countries have signed the CCD and Cape Verde is the first to ratify it. The activities carried out by countries affected by <span class=""highlight"">desertification</span> will also achieve the Climate Change Convention's objectives."
emission|co2|technology|energy|energy efficiency,"ECE:   Gianluca Sambucini discussed a ten-country study comparing national policies on <span class=""highlight"">energy</span> and <span class=""highlight"">CO2</span> <span class=""highlight"">emissions</span>. He highlighted the cooperation between ECE member States and Central and Eastern European States.   IEA:   Executive-Director Robert Priddle said that the IEA ministers have adopted a new statement on <span class=""highlight"">energy</span> goals that features environmental considerations. The adoption of policies for tackling <span class=""highlight"">energy</span> intensive <span class=""highlight"">consumption</span>, improving end-use <span class=""highlight"">energy</span> efficiency, <span class=""highlight"">technology</span> collaboration, and <span class=""highlight"">joint implementation</span> is crucial."
vulnerable,"SPREP:   Neville Koop supported the <span class=""highlight"">AOSIS protocol</span>. He cited the importance of the <span class=""highlight"">precautionary approach</span> in climate negotiations and the need for immediate action by COP-1.   Mayor of Kampala, Uganda:   Christopher Iga, on behalf of the Second Municipal Leaders' Summit on Climate Change, endorsed the <span class=""highlight"">AOSIS Protocol</span>. <span class=""highlight"">GHG emissions will continue to grow since urban dwellers will comprise half of the global population by 2005. Cities are vulnerable to climate change as well as the arena for the adoption of ecologically sound practices.</span>"
business,"Environment NGOs:   Pene Lefale, Climate Action Network (Pacific), said the lack of a clear mandate and absence of industrialized countries' support for the <span class=""highlight"">AOSIS protocol</span> is disappointing. He urged delegates to tear down the wall of cynicism at COP-1.   <span class=""highlight"">Business</span> NGOs:   Clement Malan, International Chamber of Commerce, said that it was premature to set <span class=""highlight"">new commitments</span> without better scientific understanding. He welcomed the proposal for a <span class=""highlight"">business</span> <span class=""highlight"">consultative mechanism</span>."
uncertainties|scientific uncertainty,"Uganda   noted that because many Annex I Parties have cited the <span class=""highlight"">inadequacy of commitments</span>, COP-1 should now discuss strengthening them. <span class=""highlight"">New commitments</span>, however, should not include developing countries, and the <span class=""highlight"">AOSIS proposal</span> provides a good starting point.   Venezuela   emphasized that the Parties have not yet reached agreed <span class=""highlight"">emissions</span> caps. Parties must honor existing commitments before pursuing a protocol.   The UK   observed that some delegations have drawn attention to scientific <span class=""highlight"">uncertainty</span>, but warned against underestimating what is already known. Commitments that only go to 2000 are inadequate, and are not reason enough to avoid setting a new time frame."
fuel,"Mauritius   supported the <span class=""highlight"">AOSIS proposal</span> and noted that while some States still harbor doubt, precaution alone should warrant action.   Papua New Guinea   said action on <span class=""highlight"">new commitments</span> must focus on the <span class=""highlight"">AOSIS protocol</span>, and that there is very little point in discussing about anything else if island countries are going to disappear due to <span class=""highlight"">inaction</span>.   Uruguay   endorsed charting a course on a protocol and establishing a working group at COP-2, including <span class=""highlight"">oil</span> producing countries."
fuel|vulnerable,"Nigeria   faces triple <span class=""highlight"">vulnerability</span>: environmental <span class=""highlight"">impacts of climate change</span>, the socioeconomic aspects of climate policy, and an economy dependent on <span class=""highlight"">oil</span> revenue. Additional burdens not already in the Convention are unacceptable.   Sri Lanka   said developing countries should not have to share <span class=""highlight"">new commitments</span>."
energy|private sector|renewable energy,"France  ,     on behalf of the EU, called for a progressive approach beginning with a <span class=""highlight"">pilot phase</span> that is transparent, well-defined and credible, with no credits for Annex I Parties. <span class=""highlight"">JI</span> should not be used to impose <span class=""highlight"">new commitments</span> on non-Annex I Parties.   The Russian Federation   said COP-1 should adopt criteria for <span class=""highlight"">JI</span>. He called for equality of participation by all Parties.   Costa Rica   said that <span class=""highlight"">JI</span> provides a possibility for enhancing renewable <span class=""highlight"">energy</span>. She supported the participation of the <span class=""highlight"">private sector</span>, emphasizing the need for transparency."
technology transfer|technology|private sector,"The Czech Republic   said the concept of <span class=""highlight"">JI</span> enhances the role of the <span class=""highlight"">private sector</span>, as a voluntary mutual cooperation between two or more Parties.   Colombia   said that developing countries should not assume the same obligations as developed countries. <span class=""highlight"">JI</span> should be differentiated from the <span class=""highlight"">transfer of technology and financial resources.   Argentina   supported the statements of Brazil and Chile and called for clear instructions for a pilot phase that will do away with skepticism.</span>"
investment|trigger,"Germany   said that <span class=""highlight"">JI</span> may be beneficial for developing countries since cooperative measure may improve access to technologies, <span class=""highlight"">trigger</span> <span class=""highlight"">investments</span>, and involve an exchange of experience and knowledge. He supported the <span class=""highlight"">pilot phase</span>.   Belize   agreed with Costa Rica and Chile. There should be a <span class=""highlight"">pilot phase</span> open to non-Annex I Parties.   Peru   said that COP-1 should provide criteria for <span class=""highlight"">JI</span>. He called for a <span class=""highlight"">pilot phase</span> that accommodates national <span class=""highlight"">development</span> plans."
development|sustainable development|technology transfer|technology,"India   said a <span class=""highlight"">pilot phase</span> could be launched if it was made explicit that no credits would be allocated. <span class=""highlight"">JI</span> should also be voluntary, bilateral and directly related to national <span class=""highlight"">development</span> priorities.   New Zealand   said that <span class=""highlight"">JI</span> is a means for limiting GHGs, assisting <span class=""highlight"">technology</span> transfer and promoting sustainable <span class=""highlight"">development</span>. He called for the establishment of a <span class=""highlight"">pilot phase</span> without credits designed to evaluate criteria and crediting issues.   Switzerland   said the COP should request the SBI to: evaluate the environmental soundness, effectiveness and impacts of <span class=""highlight"">pilot phase</span> projects; verify information communicated; and make recommendations for the post-<span class=""highlight"">pilot phase</span> period."
technology transfer|technology,"Indonesia   said that joint activities between developed and developing countries should be based on national priorities of the recipient country and facilitate the <span class=""highlight"">transfer technology and financial resources.   Japan   supported a JI pilot phase without credits. JI activities should be voluntary, transparent, open to all Parties, financed independently of existing ODA and provide for technology transfer</span>.   Mali   said that a <span class=""highlight"">JI</span> <span class=""highlight"">pilot phase</span> should be extended to cover developing countries, but developed countries should not assume a reduction of their commitments through <span class=""highlight"">JI</span>."
technology|private sector,"Canada   supported a phased <span class=""highlight"">JI</span> approach as a mechanism to encourage <span class=""highlight"">private sector</span> capital and to increase access to <span class=""highlight"">technology</span>. <span class=""highlight"">JI</span> participation does not impose new obligations on developing countries.   Fiji   supported a <span class=""highlight"">pilot phase</span> to help the COP set firm criteria. <span class=""highlight"">JI</span> projects should be in line with host country projects.   Cameroon   said supporting a <span class=""highlight"">pilot phase</span> appears to endorse a structure which no one really knows anything about.   Kuwait   said that any amendment of the G-77 and China proposal would involve the danger of transferring Annex I Parties' commitments to other countries. He supported initiating a <span class=""highlight"">pilot phase</span> in accordance with the G-77 criteria."
gef,"REPORT OF THE <span class=""highlight"">GEF</span> TO THE COP:   The COW then considered the report of the <span class=""highlight"">GEF</span> to the COP (FCCC/CP/1995/4). Mr. Tahar Hadj-Sadok of the Interim Secretariat introduced the document. He noted that the report was divided into two sections, the <span class=""highlight"">development</span> of an operational strategy and the initial activities undertaken by the <span class=""highlight"">GEF</span>, including enabling activities for national communications and project activities. The first section describes a two track approach. COP-1 may adopt a strategy of maximizing short-term <span class=""highlight"">cost effectiveness</span>, long term <span class=""highlight"">cost effectiveness</span>, or a mixed strategy of short and long-term priorities. The second section describes the initial activities undertaken by the <span class=""highlight"">GEF</span> on climate change."
gef|financial mechanism,"The Chair noted that COP-1 had to decide between the various approaches described. He suggested that the <span class=""highlight"">GEF</span> should take fully into account the modalities for the functioning of the <span class=""highlight"">financial mechanism</span>. He said he would hold consultations on these matters."
technology|technology transfer,"The Philippines  , on behalf of the G-77 and China, presented a draft decision on <span class=""highlight"">technology</span> transfer which would (1) refer to <span class=""highlight"">technology</span> transfer language from Agenda 21 and the Convention; (2) ask the Secretariat to compile an itemized report on <span class=""highlight"">technology</span> transfer activities of Annex II Parties; (3) direct the Secretariat to prepare an inventory of potentially transferable technologies; (4) have all measures reviewed and evaluated at subsequent COPs."
technology|private sector|technology transfer,"France  , on behalf of the EU, reiterated the importance of environmentally sound <span class=""highlight"">technology</span> transfer and noted that the main barrier is the lack of national technological capacities. He said that <span class=""highlight"">private sector</span> initiatives should be the driving force behind <span class=""highlight"">technology</span> transfer, and COP-1 must address this in a broad framework, taking into account other multilateral and bilateral channels. Benin added that the <span class=""highlight"">development</span> of national capacities should be noted."
gef,"This decision accepts the <span class=""highlight"">GEF</span> Council's two-track approach in 1995. Under track one, the <span class=""highlight"">GEF</span> Secretariat will work to develop a long-term comprehensive operational strategy, and under track two, some project activities will be undertaken to allow a smooth transition between the <span class=""highlight"">pilot phase</span> and the restructured <span class=""highlight"">GEF</span>. The decision also includes a mixed strategy wherein projects will be selected on the basis of either long-term or short-term programme priorities."
technology|technology transfer,"COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE:   The COW will meet this afternoon. The agenda will depend largely on the success of the consultations held over the weekend on such matters as the mandate for consultations on commitments, <span class=""highlight"">joint implementation</span>, <span class=""highlight"">location of the Permanent Secretariat</span> and the budget. The G-77 and China might also table their draft decision on <span class=""highlight"">technology</span> transfer."
development|sustainable development|land use|forest|technology transfer|technology,"Klaus TÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½pfer,   Chair of the UN Commission on Sustainable <span class=""highlight"">Development</span>, said that it is the mandate of the CSD to lead governments and international organizations on the road to sustainable <span class=""highlight"">development</span>. Economic growth cannot be stimulated at the expense of the environment. The world is unstable because <span class=""highlight"">development</span> has been unsustainable. The Rio Process should be as crucial for world <span class=""highlight"">peace</span> as the Helsinki Process was for Europe in the 1970s and 1980s. He noted appreciation for the draft protocol produced by the AOSIS countries and added that there is no time for reluctance. He called for adoption of a protocol and the elaboration of <span class=""highlight"">joint implementation</span> pilot projects. At its third session, which begins next week, the CSD will review the chapters of Agenda 21 related to <span class=""highlight"">land use</span>. Steps toward cooperation on all types of <span class=""highlight"">forests</span> could be negotiated in the 1995-96 intersessional period by a panel under the CSD and closely related to the FAO. The CSD will also discuss experiences in implementing national and local Agenda 21 plans, and review progress on cross-sectoral issues such as finance, <span class=""highlight"">technology</span> transfer, and sustainable production and <span class=""highlight"">consumption</span> patterns. TÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½pfer called for: utilization of potential innovative <span class=""highlight"">financial mechanisms</span>; dialogue between those responsible for environmental policy and economic policy; more attention to capacity building; a global system for monitoring and assessing progress toward sustainable <span class=""highlight"">development</span>; and common action and cooperation, including bringing the <span class=""highlight"">ODA</span> level in line with the 0.7% target, and debt reduction."
funding|financial resources|gef|financial mechanism,"Mohamed El-Ashry  , CEO and Chair of the <span class=""highlight"">Global Environment Facility</span>, noted that the <span class=""highlight"">GEF</span> restructuring and replenishment negotiations concluded in March 1994, and 141 countries are now <span class=""highlight"">GEF</span> participants. The fourth meeting of the <span class=""highlight"">GEF</span> Council will be in early May. Among the <span class=""highlight"">GEF</span>'s accomplishments so far are adoption of a 1995 work programme that approves the operational strategies and the initiation of programming of <span class=""highlight"">financial resources</span>. One priority use of such resources is to help recipient countries implement the Climate Change Convention. At its second and third meetings, the Council approved and allocated US$14 million to a project preparation and <span class=""highlight"">development</span> facility. The Council has also held its first round of discussions on a shorter project disbursement cycle. In February, the Council approved a US$30 million work programme, which includes US$10 million for climate change activities. On 15 March, the <span class=""highlight"">GEF</span> Trust <span class=""highlight"">Fund</span> became effective. He added that NGOs have been admitted as observers to the <span class=""highlight"">GEF</span> beginning with the next Council meeting. He concluded by noting that the restructured <span class=""highlight"">GEF</span> meets the Climate Change Convention's requirements for the institution entrusted with the operation of the <span class=""highlight"">financial mechanism</span> and that he regretted INC-11 did not make a more definite recommendation."
technology|technology transfer,"With regard to items that are still the subject of consultations, Mahmoud Ould El Ghaouth is chairing a drafting group on the Secretariat's budget, which is close to completion. Estrada is leading consultations on the location of the Secretariat. These talks have entered a ripe stage and it is the desire of several delegations that this item be concluded before the start of the Ministerial Segment. Amb. Bo KjellÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½n is holding consultations on the analysis of the <span class=""highlight"">adequacy of commitments</span> in Article 4.2(a) and (b) to reach the objective of the Convention. The discussions on the criteria for <span class=""highlight"">joint implementation</span> of obligations are making headway. Finally, the COW studied the item relating to the paper on subsidiary bodies, including the programmes of work and calendars of meetings. He hoped that the COW would be able to endorse this draft. The G-77 also prepared a draft decision on <span class=""highlight"">technology</span> transfer, and Estrada hoped to make progress."
eit|economies in transition,"Other conclusions from INC-11 have been agreed upon but are not included in the recommendations. The COP agreed that the following recommendations would be included under Agenda Item 6(c), Conclusion of outstanding issues and adoption of decisions, to be discussed during the Ministerial Segment: Conclusion (g), modalities for the functioning of operational linkages between the COP and <span class=""highlight"">operating entity</span> (Agenda Item 5(b)); Conclusion (h), provision to developing country Parties of technical and <span class=""highlight"">financial support</span> (Agenda Item 5(c)); and Conclusion (p), a multilateral consultative process formulation (Agenda Item 5(e)). Poland asked how the reservation to Recommendation 3, on national communications, made by countries with <span class=""highlight"">economies in transition</span>, would be handled. The President said that consultations are continuing and she will notify the interested delegations if progress is achieved."
funding|energy|renewable energy|investment,"STATEMENTS:     Israel   stated that it will become a Party in the next few months, and expressed concern about global change. Weather changes would affect his country greatly, and the risk of <span class=""highlight"">inaction</span> is too great.   The World Bank   outlined principles and projects for assisting in climate change mitigation, and added that successful projects depend upon the leveraging of other <span class=""highlight"">funding</span> sources. He described ongoing efforts such as the Solar Initiative and an <span class=""highlight"">investment</span> <span class=""highlight"">fund</span> for renewable <span class=""highlight"">energy</span> production."

Alvarez (the Philippines) spoke on behalf of the   East Asia &amp; Pacific Parliamentarians' Conference on Environment and <span class=""highlight"">Development</span>  , and stated that the Asia-Pacific region is extremely <span class=""highlight"">vulnerable</span> to climate change and should be given special status. He noted that developing countries cannot accept any <span class=""highlight"">new commitments</span> and called upon developed countries to provide <span class=""highlight"">technology</span> transfer and <span class=""highlight"">financial assistance</span>. He also supported the <span class=""highlight"">AOSIS protocol</span>."
technology|technology transfer,"The Chair said that no draft decision on <span class=""highlight"">technology</span> transfer was yet available and asked the Philippines, on behalf of the G-77, and France, on behalf of EU, to produce a document in time for Tuesday's session of the COW. Estrada also said that no consensus was yet apparent on a means to decide on the <span class=""highlight"">location of the Permanent Secretariat</span>. Various means have been considered, including an informal confidential survey of delegations' preferences by secret ballot, with an absolute majority deciding between the four offers. He said the original agreement was that a decision would be taken at Berlin and preferably prior to the ministerial session, but one of the four candidate delegations has insisted that the decision not be taken in Berlin. He said he recognized that the general feeling of the house was to take a decision at COP-1. Canada said its understanding was that there is no consensus on this point. The Chair said he would wait for Canada to support his proposal."
commitments for non-annex i,"When the consultations reconvened on Monday afternoon, OECD countries distributed their comments on the paper produced by the like-minded States. The consultations adjourned so that the G-77 could review the OECD comments and the Chair, Amb. Bo KjellÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½n, requested that the various groups select representatives so that a group of 25 Friends of the Chair could convene at 7:00 pm to begin negotiations. This group of Friends was to consist of four members of the EU, four other OECD country representatives, two <span class=""highlight"">OPEC</span> countries, two Eastern European countries, and the remaining delegates from the newly named Group of 69. The Friends of the Chair were expected to meet late into the night. Some of the issues expected to dominate the discussion were: <span class=""highlight"">commitments for developing</span> country Parties; setting specific and <span class=""highlight"">legally binding</span> reduction targets (e.g. Toronto Targets) within specified timeframes; combining a reduction target for Annex I Parties with measures such as transfer of <span class=""highlight"">financial resources</span> and <span class=""highlight"">technology</span> to developing countries; and the target date for completion of the negotiations."
technology transfer|technology,"COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE:   The COW is scheduled to meet from 10:00 am - 2:00 pm to complete all outstanding matters, if humanly possible. Outstanding issues include <span class=""highlight"">joint implementation</span> (although it is expected that the G-77 will table a draft proposal to establish a <span class=""highlight"">JI</span> <span class=""highlight"">pilot phase</span>); <span class=""highlight"">adequacy of commitments</span>; the budget for the Permanent Secretariat; the <span class=""highlight"">location of the Permanent Secretariat</span>; and the G-77 proposal on <span class=""highlight"">technology</span> transfer."

technology|technology transfer,"TRANSFER OF <span class=""highlight"">TECHNOLOGY</span>:   The G-77 and Chinas revised draft decision on <span class=""highlight"">technology</span> transfer was distributed. The Republic of Korea, on behalf of the G-77 and China, noted that after consultations with other groups only three sets of brackets remained in the document."
technology|technology transfer|know-how,"The first brackets were in the second preambular paragraph that lists relevant provisions of the Convention related to <span class=""highlight"">technology</span> transfer. The EU wanted to add a reference to Article 4.1. The G-77 and China thought this was unacceptable. The UK pointed out that Article 4.1(c) relates to the transfer of <span class=""highlight"">technology</span> and Article 4.1 as a whole contains obligations of all Parties. Australia supported the reference to Article 4.1 and noted that more discussion is needed on paragraph 1(b) concerning an inventory and assessment of environmentally sound and economically viable technologies and <span class=""highlight"">know-how</span> conducive to mitigating and adapting to climate change."
technology|technology transfer,"The US, supported by New Zealand, thought further discussion was necessary. He asked if it was necessary to set the agendas for all future COPs in paragraph 3(a) and who will provide the advice to improve the operational modalities for the effective transfer of <span class=""highlight"">technology</span> in paragraph 3(b). After several additional proposals by China, the Netherlands, the US and the Republic of Korea, the Chair noted that the discussion must come to an end, closed the debate and suggested that the Committee adopt the text with the original compromise suggested by the Republic of Korea, on behalf of the G-77 and China, and accepted by the EU. Despite protestations by the US that its concerns had not been addressed, the Chair gavelled this matter to a close and the text was adopted."
funding,"BUDGET FOR THE PERMANENT SECRETARIAT:   The Chair of the budget consultations, Mahmoud Ould El Ghaouth, said that a small number of political decisions remain that will affect the Convention budget for the biennium 1996-1997 (FCCC/CP/1995/L.4), and that their resolution will require completion of the budget figures. The document contains no figures for contributions from the host government, which will depend on the physical <span class=""highlight"">location of the Permanent Secretariat</span>. It also has blanks for administration overhead and the year-end balance from voluntary <span class=""highlight"">funds</span>. El Ghaouth also presented the draft decisions on extrabudgetary <span class=""highlight"">funding</span> for the interim secretariat for 1995 (FCCC/CP/1995/L.7) and other voluntary <span class=""highlight"">funding</span> for the biennium 1996-1997 (FCCC/CP/1995/L.8) for consideration."
funding,"At the suggestion of France, a footnote was added to L.4 explaining that the working capital reserve amounted to 8.3% of the operating budget, equivalent to one months budget. A US recommendation to change a reference in L.8 from a special voluntary <span class=""highlight"">fund</span> into a special <span class=""highlight"">fund</span> was also agreed. The Executive Secretary indicated that the rules describe a special <span class=""highlight"">fund</span> with voluntary contributions, but that the amendment would not make the contribution an assessed one. The documents were recommended to the COP for adoption."
technology|technology transfer,"The fourth Plenary meeting opened with a report from Amb. Estrada on the work of the Committee of the Whole. He stated that the COW had agreed on the draft decisions concerning the Secretariats budget, and recommended them for approval under Agenda Item 6. He also stated that a compromise had been reached during discussions on <span class=""highlight"">technology</span> transfer and that the decision is currently being translated."
gef|funding|technology|technology transfer,"The President presented some items to be adopted on the final day of COP-1, including several recommendations and conclusions from INC-11.

He stated that the Rio Conference provided a clear signal of hope, but the recent recession shows that sustainable <span class=""highlight"">development</span> does not sufficiently determine the actions of States. He stressed three central issues: industrialized country responsibility to limit <span class=""highlight"">CO2</span> <span class=""highlight"">emissions</span> permanently beyond the year 2000; a negotiation mandate from this Conference for a noticeable reduction in greenhouse <span class=""highlight"">gas</span> (GHG) <span class=""highlight"">emissions</span> after 2000; and agreement on <span class=""highlight"">joint implementation</span> to facilitate the transfer of <span class=""highlight"">know-how</span> and <span class=""highlight"">technology</span>."

They debated the nature, content and duration of the analysis and assessment and its relationship to other aspects of the process. Several developed and developing countries stressed that analysis and assessment should be conducted in parallel and not prior to the negotiations, but a few developing countries held that more time was needed, particularly to evaluate economic costs. (See _Earth Negotiations Bulletin_ Vol. 12 No. 22.). At AGBM-2, held in Geneva from 30 October - 3 November 1995, debate over the extent of analysis and assessment continued, but delegates also heard new ideas for the structure and form of a possible protocol. Delegates considered: strengthening of commitments in Article 4.2 (a) and (b) regarding <span class=""highlight"">policies and measures</span>, as well as <span class=""highlight"">quantified emission limitation and reduction objectives</span> within specified time-frames; advancing the implementation of Article 4.1; and possible features of a protocol or other legal instrument.

The first meeting of the SBSTA (SBSTA-1) was held in Geneva from 28-30 August 1995. Delegates confronted technically and politically complex issues, including: scientific assessments, national communications from Annex I Parties, methodologies, first communications from non-Annex I Parties, and activities <span class=""highlight"">implemented jointly</span> under the <span class=""highlight"">pilot phase</span>. The SBSTA also was to establish intergovernmental technical advisory panels on technologies (TAP-T) and methodologies (TAP-M), however, it did not have time to consider all of these issues. Among the more contentious issues were: definition of the SBSTAÂ’s relationship with the <span class=""highlight"">IPCC</span>, the terms of reference and composition of the TAPs and the elaboration of guidelines for national communications from non-Annex I Parties. Delegates successfully identified areas for cooperation with the <span class=""highlight"">IPCC</span>, agreed on a division of labor with the SBI on <span class=""highlight"">technology</span> transfer issues, and requested the Secretariat to organize a workshop on non- governmental inputs.

The main result was that Parties documented that they could not yet agree on how to absorb or respond to scientific predictions of climate change. Although initial discussions gave the impression that SBSTA-2 would greet the <span class=""highlight"">IPCC</span>Â’s predictions with less resistance than in previous FCCC negotiations, <span class=""highlight"">oil</span> producers and other developing countries ultimately blocked consensus on specific conclusions about the <span class=""highlight"">IPCC</span> <span class=""highlight"">Second Assessment Report</span>. Weekend negotiations resulted in a fragile agreement on language defining the divergence of opinion. Three paragraphs in the SBSTAÂ’s report list points of contention, alternately highlighting the urgency and <span class=""highlight"">uncertainty</span> in the <span class=""highlight"">IPCC</span> report of a Â“discernible human influenceÂ” on climate change.

He also noted the need to <span class=""highlight"">fund</span> the Climate Agenda, an initiative to establish a framework for international climate-related scientific programmes."
technology transfer|technology|private sector|technology transfer mechanism,"Elizabeth Dowdeswell, Executive Director of UNEP, noted that the lack of full scientific certainty should not be used as an excuse to postpone action and that the atmosphere will continue to change until Parties choose to control their <span class=""highlight"">emissions</span>. She called for a global <span class=""highlight"">emission</span> cap, access to <span class=""highlight"">financial mechanisms</span> and <span class=""highlight"">technology</span> transfer for developing countries, and access to reliable information by decision makers. She noted opportunities for action, including: reaping the benefits of integrated resource management; ensuring rationality in actions to protect the environment; engaging the <span class=""highlight"">private sector</span> and civil society; and analyzing market and non-<span class=""highlight"">market mechanisms</span>."
co2|emission|intergovernmental panel on climate change,"Bert Bolin, Chair of the <span class=""highlight"">IPCC</span>, reiterated the conclusion of the <span class=""highlight"">SAR</span> that suggests a discernable human influence on global climate. He highlighted: masking of global warming by aerosol <span class=""highlight"">emissions</span>; <span class=""highlight"">emission</span> limits necessary to stabilize <span class=""highlight"">carbon dioxide</span> concentrations; additional <span class=""highlight"">IPCC</span> papers on climate stabilisation, environmental implications of <span class=""highlight"">emissions</span> limitations and <span class=""highlight"">policies and measures</span>; and critical evaluation of the <span class=""highlight"">SAR</span>. He objected to criticism that the <span class=""highlight"">IPCC</span> had violated its procedures in preparation of the <span class=""highlight"">SAR</span>."
gef|financial mechanism,"Mohamed El-Ashry, Chair and CEO of the <span class=""highlight"">GEF</span>, stated that between February 1995 and April 1996, the <span class=""highlight"">GEF</span> Council approved US$215 million for climate change activities. He emphasized that the recently adopted <span class=""highlight"">GEF</span> Operational Strategy contained a chapter on climate change that had been developed under COP-1 guidance. He called upon COP-2 to consider the permanent <span class=""highlight"">financial mechanism</span> of the FCCC."
funding|research and development|energy,"Robert Priddle, Executive Director of the International <span class=""highlight"">Energy</span> Agency of the OECD, focused on the <span class=""highlight"">Berlin Mandate</span>. He highlighted the long time necessary to achieve infrastructural change in the <span class=""highlight"">energy</span> sector, calling for long term commitments from Annex I countries including policy instruments and <span class=""highlight"">funding</span> for <span class=""highlight"">research and development.</span>"
energy efficiency|research and development|energy|renewable energy,"Anders Wijkman, UNDP, called on governments to create a level playing field between all <span class=""highlight"">energy</span> suppliers, enforce the polluter pays principle, and focus <span class=""highlight"">research and development on increasing energy efficiency</span> and identifying renewable <span class=""highlight"">energy</span> sources. He said OECD countries should provide a leadership role and that the <span class=""highlight"">GEF</span> should be strengthened."
small island,"Parties proceeded to the adoption of the Agenda (FCCC/CP/1996/1). Under Item 4 (a) on National Communications from Parties Included in Annex 1, the President reported that the United Republic of Tanzania and Qatar are to become signatories to the FCCC before the end of the Conference, and Israel will become a non-Annex 1 Party in August. The Czech Republic, Morocco, and Slovakia have applied to become Annex 1 Parties. Introducing Agenda Item 4 (b), Adoption of the Rules of Procedure, the President said he would conduct consultations to resolve the issue of rule 42 (voting). SAUDI ARABIA said agreement on rule 22 (election of officers) is also pending. Rule 22 should be limited to regional group representatives. The President said each of the five regional groups are to be represented by two Bureau members and one Bureau member will represent the <span class=""highlight"">small island</span> developing states (<span class=""highlight"">SIDS</span>). SAUDI ARABIA objected to the nomination of a Bureau member from Samoa to represent <span class=""highlight"">SIDS</span>. The US said it was important to follow precedent in the election of officers to the Bureau and include the <span class=""highlight"">SIDS</span> nominee. Parties proceeded to the election of the Bureau. GERMANY said the <span class=""highlight"">SIDS</span> were represented in the Bureau of the INC in 1991. SAUDI ARABIA said he could not support the elections as proposed. The President postponed the election of vice-presidents."
gef,"An informal meeting held last week in Frankfurt, sponsored by the government of Germany, formed the basis for closer cooperation between the secretariats of the Convention on <span class=""highlight"">Biological Diversity</span> (CBD) and the <span class=""highlight"">GEF</span>. According to one participant, relations between the <span class=""highlight"">GEF</span> and the CBD are complicated by language in the convention stating that the <span class=""highlight"">GEF</span> shall operate under the authority of the CBD, as well as by the absence of an intersessional mechanism to discuss financial issues (unlike the FCCC). The meeting established a process for consultations between the two bodies in a revised Memorandum of Understanding."
human rights,"Chair Patrick Szell (United Kingdom) introduced the panel on compliance procedures (Article 13) sponsored by the _Ad Hoc_ Group on Article 13 (AG-13). The ILO emphasized non-confrontational procedures to encourage compliance with ILO conventions, as well as the occasional use of adversarial procedures to deal with complaints against States that have not ratified specific conventions. The WTO said failure to implement changes as directed by a panel can lead to a right to retaliate. The International Instruments Branch of the Centre for <span class=""highlight"">Human Rights</span> said the primary aim of implementation procedures is to assist governments. A quasi-judicial process is also available. The Secretariat of the Basel Convention said an Open-ended _Ad Hoc _Committee for implementation has been established to examine annual reports. Any Party can report a breach of obligations by another. The <span class=""highlight"">Montreal Protocol</span> Implementation Committee Chair said the <span class=""highlight"">Montreal Protocol</span> views traditional methods of bipolar dispute settlement as not sufficient."
funding,"The Chair then introduced Agenda Item 7(b) on income and budget performance, and resource deployment for 1997 (FCCC/CP/1996/7 and Add.1). The Secretariat summarized Add.1 on the financial performance of the FCCC, contributions and expenditures in 1996, and the forecast for 1996-97. There will be an annual payment of DM1.5 million per year from the German Government and lower staff costs arising from relocation to Bonn. Thirty-five Parties have paid contributions in full and expenditures are in line with COP-1 estimates. Additional requirements for 1996 amount to US$158,000, and US$867,400 for 1997. Germany will contribute an additional DM3.5 million annually to a special <span class=""highlight"">fund</span>. Executive Secretary Michael Zammit-Cutajar noted that no additional core resources are being sought for 1997. He proposed a revision of the capital reserve level, up from 8.3% of the core budget to 15%. Responding to questions from the US and the EU, the Secretariat said budgeting beyond 1997 will be addressed at the next session of the SBI. No activity is given greater priority than in-depth reviews. JAPAN questioned the proposal to revise the level of working capital reserves. The Chair invited delegations to interact with their capitals to resolve the issue. The SBI then recommended approval of the programme of work for 1996-1997 (FCCC/SBI/1996/11)."
small island|vulnerable|most vulnerable,"The EU recalled that the preliminary views of delegations concerning the <span class=""highlight"">SAR</span> were recorded in the report of the last meeting. He urged the COP to endorse the <span class=""highlight"">SAR</span> and accept it as the most comprehensive assessment of available <span class=""highlight"">scientific information</span> on climate change. Many also expressed support for the <span class=""highlight"">SAR</span> and made specific comments, including the US, CANADA, ARGENTINA, the REPUBLIC OF KOREA, COLOMBIA, NEW ZEALAND, BANGLADESH, NORWAY, FIJI, URUGUAY, MAURITIUS, JAPAN, BENIN, MYANMAR, BULGARIA and GREENPEACE. SAMOA, on behalf of AOSIS, supported adoption of the <span class=""highlight"">SAR</span> and noted the conclusion that <span class=""highlight"">SIDS</span> are among the most <span class=""highlight"">vulnerable</span> to climate change. This was seconded by MICRONESIA, the MALDIVES, the MARSHALL ISLANDS and NIUE."
intergovernmental panel on climate change,"INDIA said SBSTA should not base its recommendations solely on the <span class=""highlight"">SAR</span> and suggested the <span class=""highlight"">IPCC</span> examine the <span class=""highlight"">effects of climate change</span> in non-Annex I countries caused by extraterritorial activities and natural climate variability in greater detail. The Chair reminded delegates that SBSTA is mandated to advise the COP and decision- makers based on findings of the <span class=""highlight"">IPCC</span>, but may ask for and consider additional information. PAKISTAN cautioned against the use of global generalizations and recommended that the <span class=""highlight"">SAR</span> be amended to reflect regional differences in climate change."
vulnerable,"The PHILIPPINES, supported by INDONESIA and BRAZIL, said the <span class=""highlight"">SAR</span> should be used as a comprehensive whole and not selectively. The heightened <span class=""highlight"">vulnerability</span> of developing countries and <span class=""highlight"">equity</span> concerns should be further considered. SWITZERLAND agreed the <span class=""highlight"">SAR</span> should not be used selectively and that low cost abatement measures, even beyond Â“no regretsÂ”, should be taken immediately. SRI LANKA cautioned against oversimplification of the <span class=""highlight"">SAR</span> findings, stating that ambiguities have resulted from the use of Â“extremeÂ” numerical values."
intergovernmental panel on climate change,"CENTRAL AFRICAN REPUBLIC, supported by ZIMBABWE, called for an addendum to the <span class=""highlight"">SAR</span> noting SBSTAÂ’s comments. KOREA suggested that the <span class=""highlight"">IPCC</span> try to work more economically by avoiding duplication of work and enhanced data sharing. GEORGIA called for analysis of national and regional impacts, saying mitigation measures would not otherwise be possible. The <span class=""highlight"">IPCC</span> CHAIR noted the need to distinguish between scientific assessments and the policies arising out of them and recommended the COP set tentative <span class=""highlight"">emission</span> targets."
technology|performance indicators|technology transfer,"Delegates began consideration of Agenda Item 4(a) (national communications of Annex I Parties). The Secretariat introduced the document on possible revision of the guidelines (FCCC/SBSTA/1996/9). JAPAN, supported by the US, proposed a separate informal session to discuss the revised guidelines. CHINA, supported by INDIA, highlighted the importance of <span class=""highlight"">technology</span> transfer and called for including language in the body of the guidelines. The EU approved extending the minimum information required and recommended that the revised guidelines include direction for preferred timetables. POLAND and HUNGARY said second reports are being prepared and changing guidelines will lead to delays. SWITZERLAND proposed discussing amendments on a paragraph by paragraph basis. AUSTRALIA highlighted <span class=""highlight"">performance indicators</span>."
fuel,"COP President Chen Chimutengwende is reported to have begun informal consultations on the unresolved Rules of Procedure. One delegate suggested a resolution in which developed countries relax their requirements for voting on financial issues in return for cooperation from the <span class=""highlight"">oil</span> producing states."
funding|gef,"SBI met formally to consider Agenda item 4 (financial and technical cooperation). The Secretariat introduced the <span class=""highlight"">GEF</span> Report to COP-2 (FCCC/CP/1996/8), which considers the relationship between the <span class=""highlight"">GEF</span> and the COP. The Secretariat also introduced a draft Annex to the draft Memorandum of Understanding between the <span class=""highlight"">GEF</span> and COP (MOU) on determination of necessary <span class=""highlight"">funding</span> and its availability for implementation of the FCCC (FCCC/CP/1996/9)."
funding|gef,"The G-77/CHINA requested a postponement of discussion. The EU and the US welcomed the <span class=""highlight"">GEF</span> report, especially the operational strategy and its emphasis on enabling activities, and, along with POLAND, supported designation of the <span class=""highlight"">GEF</span> as the permanent <span class=""highlight"">funding</span> mechanism. FRANCE cautioned that failure to approve the <span class=""highlight"">funding</span> document might hinder input from the COP to the next <span class=""highlight"">GEF</span> replenishment. The Chair postponed discussion until Thursday."
technology transfer|technology,"Debate resumed on Agenda Item 4(a) (national communications from Annex I Parties). The G-77/CHINA, supported by COLOMBIA and INDIA, proposed Annex I parties communicate <span class=""highlight"">GHG emission limitations and commitments related to financial resources and technology transfer</span>. ESTONIA, supported by LATVIA and the REPUBLIC OF KOREA, said guidelines should be revised with <span class=""highlight"">flexibility</span>."
technology|technology transfer,"The MARSHALL ISLANDS and MICRONESIA highlighted the need for information related to <span class=""highlight"">technology</span> transfer for adaptation. UZBEKISTAN said the guidelines should contain more detail, including guidelines for <span class=""highlight"">emission</span> control. NORWAY and CANADA suggested introducing their proposals for technical revisions in a contact group. CHINA noted that Annex I Parties are committed to assisting developing countries through <span class=""highlight"">technology</span> transfer and <span class=""highlight"">financial assistance</span>, but this has not been highlighted in the documents revision."
bunker fuels|fuel|emission|greenhouse gas emissions,"The Secretariat introduced additional documents for the agenda item: methodological issues (FCCC/SBSTA/ 1996/9/Add.1) and electricity trade and <span class=""highlight"">bunker fuels</span> (Add.2). The Chair noted he would convene a contact group on these issues. The RUSSIAN FEDERATION drew attention to problems with net <span class=""highlight"">emissions</span> and noted the absence of a recognized principle on accounting for timber exports. The EU stressed that allocation issues cannot be isolated from <span class=""highlight"">development</span> of <span class=""highlight"">policies and measures</span> for GHG <span class=""highlight"">emissions</span>, and suggested that AGBM should elaborate <span class=""highlight"">policies and measures</span> on <span class=""highlight"">bunker fuel emissions.</span>"
business,"SBSTA then considered Agenda Item 7 (mechanisms for consultations with NGOs). The President introduced the relevant documents (FCCC/SBSTA/1996/11 and FCCC/SBSTA/1996/ Misc.2). The EU, supported by JAPAN, strongly supported the role of NGOs and remained open to tailoring different mechanisms for different NGO constituencies. The US said expanding access to only one type of NGO would be inappropriate and suggested strengthening existing channels. NEW ZEALAND urged the <span class=""highlight"">development</span> of a special <span class=""highlight"">consultative mechanism</span> for <span class=""highlight"">business</span> NGOs as they will play a vital role in implementation. CANADA supported a <span class=""highlight"">business</span> <span class=""highlight"">consultative mechanism</span> if it will facilitate implementation and opposed open access to NGOs on the floor during negotiations."
business,"CLIMATE ACTION NETWORK sought equitable participation among all NGOs, enhancement of existing <span class=""highlight"">consultative mechanisms</span> and expanded access to the floor during negotiations. INTERNATIONAL CHAMBER OF COMMERCE supported the <span class=""highlight"">development</span> of a <span class=""highlight"">business</span> <span class=""highlight"">consultative mechanism</span>, noting the importance of <span class=""highlight"">business</span> input in implementation and acknowledging the need for transparency. The President urged New Zealand to take the lead in forming a contact group to make recommendations to SBSTA on the issue."
funding|gef,"SBI returned to Agenda Item 4, financial and technical cooperation (FCCC/CP/1996/8 &amp; 9 and FCCC/SBI/1996/10). The G-77/CHINA called for harmonization of <span class=""highlight"">GEF</span> strategies with those of FCCC, specifically: more flexible processes; clarifying incremental cost; removing conditionalities from <span class=""highlight"">GEF</span> replenishment negotiations; and eliminating criteria of cost- effectiveness and avoiding duplication in <span class=""highlight"">funding</span> for national communications. He later submitted a revised draft on the item."
funding|gef|financial mechanism,"Several developed country delegations endorsed the ChairÂ’s text on the <span class=""highlight"">financial mechanism</span>. SWITZERLAND and CANADA called for expedited <span class=""highlight"">funding</span> for national communications. FRANCE suggested that Parties submit complaints about <span class=""highlight"">GEF</span> performance for review at future COP sessions. KENYA said many African countries are experiencing excessive delays and linkage of projects to operational conditions not required by FCCC."
gef|funding,"MICRONESIA said <span class=""highlight"">small island</span> States need the <span class=""highlight"">GEF</span> to prioritize enabling activities and to be more responsive. JAPAN opposed the draft MOU approved by the <span class=""highlight"">GEF</span> Council. KUWAIT said the COP is the supreme body as affirmed in Article 11.1 of the FCCC and not the <span class=""highlight"">GEF</span> Council. CHINA said the <span class=""highlight"">GEF</span> should accelerate project approval. The US conceded delays in developing guidelines on enabling activities but opposed the suggestion that <span class=""highlight"">cost effectiveness</span> should not be a criteria. He discouraged micromanagement of the <span class=""highlight"">GEF</span>. AUSTRALIA supported streamlining efforts. MEXICO supported the MOU and Annex. TUNISIA reported delays in <span class=""highlight"">GEF</span> <span class=""highlight"">funding</span> approval. The Chair noted a <span class=""highlight"">GEF</span> Council undertaking to accelerate decision making. He invited Parties to refer draft decisions to an informal group chaired by John Ashe (Antigua and Barbuda)."
1990 levels|greenhouse gas emissions|emission|emissions inventories,"The Chair then introduced Agenda item 3 (national communications), including the second compilation of first national communications from Annex I Parties (FCCC/CP/ 1996/12 and Add.1) and <span class=""highlight"">emission</span> inventories and projections for 2000 (Add.2) and the reporting schedule (FCCC/CP/1996/13). The G-77/CHINA expressed concern that few developed countries would reduce <span class=""highlight"">emissions</span> to <span class=""highlight"">1990 levels</span> by 2000. The RUSSIAN FEDERATION called for expanded analysis of <span class=""highlight"">GHG emissions. The EU, supported by AUSTRALIA, said the documents are the principal source to assess progress. The US called for GHG emissions significantly below 1990 levels and policies beyond no-regrets actions.</span>"
technology|technology transfer,"SBSTA resumed discussion of <span class=""highlight"">AIJ</span> following a meeting of the G-77/CHINA. The EU suggested reporting requirements be standardized, simplified, and more reflective of project <span class=""highlight"">cost effectiveness</span>, and encouraged workshops. The G-77/CHINA, supported by COLOMBIA, INDIA and URAGUAY, noted the need to better distinguish between <span class=""highlight"">AIJ</span> projects and those <span class=""highlight"">jointly implemented</span> by Annex I countries. Financing and <span class=""highlight"">technology</span> transfer for <span class=""highlight"">AIJ</span> projects must be supplemental to what is stipulated in the FCCC. The CZECH REPUBLIC urged adherence to the framework for pilot projects adopted at COP-1 and supported the establishment of a uniform reporting format."
social costs|technology|technology transfer,"AUSTRALIA and PANAMA supported <span class=""highlight"">AIJ</span> workshops and a uniform reporting format that is not onerous for developing countries. The PHILIPPINES, supported by EL SALVADOR, underscored <span class=""highlight"">technology</span> transfer, capacity building, and analysis of <span class=""highlight"">social impacts</span> in <span class=""highlight"">AIJ</span> projects and called for transparency in reporting. NORWAY said it would be premature to draw conclusions from the <span class=""highlight"">pilot phase</span> and proposed the establishment of an <span class=""highlight"">AIJ</span> forum at SBSTAÂ’s December 1996 meeting. NICARAGUA supported NORWAYÂ’s proposal and uniform reporting requirements."
funding|gef,"MALAYSIA supported by CHINA recommended deferring <span class=""highlight"">AIJ</span> workshops until after COP-3 to avoid basing decisions on inaccurate information and requested information on budgetary implications of holding an <span class=""highlight"">AIJ</span> forum. IRAN noted that the principle of cost- effectiveness was not applied in <span class=""highlight"">AIJ</span> process and that some <span class=""highlight"">AIJ</span> projects have been financed with <span class=""highlight"">GEF</span> <span class=""highlight"">funds</span>. The Chair convened a group to produce conclusions on the item."
intergovernmental panel on climate change,"SBSTA resumed in the afternoon to consider Agenda Item 8(d) (long-term work of SBSTA). The Chair introduced text which was accepted. On Agenda Item 8(c) (cooperation with <span class=""highlight"">IPCC</span>), several delegations including the EU, AUSTRALIA, US, CANADA, MYANMAR and MAURITIUS endorsed the <span class=""highlight"">IPCC</span>. The RUSSIAN FEDERATION encouraged clarification of SBSTAÂ’s relationship to the <span class=""highlight"">IPCC</span> concerning the use of data. BURKINA FASO called on the <span class=""highlight"">IPCC</span> to expand research on regional <span class=""highlight"">GHG emission limitations. The ICAO sought additional research on the atmospheric effects of aviation. The Chair offered text on the item, which was accepted.</span>"
business,"On the <span class=""highlight"">business</span> <span class=""highlight"">consultative mechanism</span>, NEW ZEALAND reported the draft results of a contact group. The text proposes that the Secretariat explore further current mechanisms and procedures to improve efficiency."
technology|technology transfer,"On Agenda Item 7 (<span class=""highlight"">technology</span> transfer), delegates considered the initial report on an inventory and assessment of technologies (FCCC/SBSTA/1996/4/Add.2 ) and a follow-up report on technological issues (FCCC/CP/1996/11). The EU said first priority should be given to identification of <span class=""highlight"">technology</span> needs and the Secretariat should focus on existing systems information centers. IRAN called for establishment of an information pool on <span class=""highlight"">technology</span> transfer. MALAYSIA expressed disappointment and said the report clearly describes developed country indifference."
technology|private sector|technology transfer|energy|enabling environment,"The NETHERLANDS and the INTERNATIONAL <span class=""highlight"">ENERGY</span> AGENCY described the Climate <span class=""highlight"">Technology</span> Initiative, a cooperative effort to support the FCCC. CHINA suggested the Secretariat prepare a proposal on the format for their communication from Annex II on <span class=""highlight"">technology</span> transfer. CANADA said governments must provide an <span class=""highlight"">enabling environment</span> for the <span class=""highlight"">private sector</span> to facilitate <span class=""highlight"">technology</span> transfer."
technology|private sector|technology transfer,"The PHILIPPINES urged a hastening of work on <span class=""highlight"">technology</span> assessment and transfer. The US noted the need for better reporting on <span class=""highlight"">technology</span> transfer. He suggested Â“virtualÂ” <span class=""highlight"">technology</span> information centers and a clearing house function for the FCCC with <span class=""highlight"">private sector</span> input."
fuel,"Observers were heard speculating on the outcome of Thursday nightÂ’s contact group on the rules of procedure. Some said it could result in an agreement that institutionalizes the _status quo_, wherein <span class=""highlight"">oil</span>-producing states would not receive their own seat on the Bureau but would be assured a regional group seat. Others predicted that some governments were still strongly opposed to this outcome and the group would likely result in a stalemate."
technology|private sector|technology transfer,"The meeting then turned to Agenda Item 5 (<span class=""highlight"">technology</span> transfer). The Secretariat introduced its reports, terms of <span class=""highlight"">technology</span> transfer (FCCC/CP/1996/11) and <span class=""highlight"">private sector</span> activities (FCCC/SBSTA/1996/4 - Add.2). The G-77/CHINA highlighted Article 4.7 (<span class=""highlight"">technology</span> transfer), suggesting a meeting on <span class=""highlight"">technology</span> adaptation. Supported by MALAYSIA, he stated that Annex I data was not comparable to Annex II data."
ldcs|technology|private sector|technology transfer,"The EU, supported by the US, suggested the Secretariat focus on voluntary <span class=""highlight"">private sector</span> <span class=""highlight"">technology</span> transfer and on enabling conditions for its transfer. The US recommended reporting this in Annex I communications. CHINA stated that Annex II communications under-emphasize <span class=""highlight"">technology</span> transfer. BANGLADESH underlined the needs of <span class=""highlight"">LDCs</span>. The MARSHALL ISLANDS highlighted <span class=""highlight"">technology</span> adaptation. CHINA and EGYPT underscored a governmental role."
gef|annex i national communications,"The Chair stated that he would confer with SBSTA to discuss whether SBI should consider <span class=""highlight"">AIJ</span> issues. The meeting adjourned and a contact group on communication with the <span class=""highlight"">GEF</span> met, chaired by John Ashe (Antigua and Barbuda). A contact group on <span class=""highlight"">Annex I national communications</span> also met, chaired by John Drexhage (Canada)."
policies and measures|binding commitments,"<span class=""highlight"">POLICIES AND MEASURES</span>:   The session considered proposals for a protocol on <span class=""highlight"">policies and measures</span> to implement FCCC. Debate centered on the pros and cons of <span class=""highlight"">mandatory policies</span> and measures and their market driven alternatives. The US said while Parties generally agree it is necessary to move forward, no single set of <span class=""highlight"">policies and measures</span> could apply to all countries given diverging circumstances. He sought an individual approach, noting the value of monitoring and reporting. The EU stated that a coordinated/<span class=""highlight"">mandatory approach</span> would enhance progress by reducing participantsÂ’ <span class=""highlight"">opportunity costs</span>. He suggested categorization of policy measures and Party selection. The RUSSIAN FEDERATION called for categorization and prioritization."
fuel|economies in transition|eit|energy|renewable energy,"The CZECH REPUBLIC sought assistance to countries with <span class=""highlight"">economies in transition</span> because their growth potential is substantial. URUGUAY called for <span class=""highlight"">solidarity</span> and noted that the COP continues to discuss the sex of angels while some countries are suffering the effects of <span class=""highlight"">inaction</span>. The SIERRA CLUB stressed renewable <span class=""highlight"">energy</span> projects rather than revenue intensive ones, coordinated <span class=""highlight"">fuel</span> standards for vehicles and <span class=""highlight"">emissions</span> targets. AUSTRALIA stated that the range of measures must be comprehensive and cautioned against selective sectoral processes in the absence of established criteria. NORWAY stressed sustainable production and <span class=""highlight"">consumption</span> patterns and called on Parties to support lifestyle changes. SAUDI ARABIA and IRAN supported a cooperative approach, particularly in addressing economic concerns, while the UK favored an individualistic one. KENYA recommended that <span class=""highlight"">policies and measures</span> be market-driven."
qelros,"<span class=""highlight"">QELROs</span>:   An afternoon Round Table considered Quantified <span class=""highlight"">Emissions</span> Limitations and Reduction Objectives (<span class=""highlight"">QELROs</span>) with discussants from Germany, Japan, Samoa, the Russian Federation, the Philippines, and ABARE Commodity Forecasting and Economic Policy Research. Supporters of targets proposed new GHG reduction targets of 10% to 20% by 2005, and 15-20% by 2010, noted non-compliance with existing objectives by developed countries, and suggested a purely cost-benefit approach will lead to further <span class=""highlight"">inaction</span>. Others questioned the feasibility of a uniform reduction target or suggested that the <span class=""highlight"">SAR</span> demonstrates it is too early to judge limits and levels of reduction without an assessment of costs and benefits."
intergovernmental panel on climate change|qelros,"On the scientific or political basis of <span class=""highlight"">QELROs</span> discussants said negotiations are influenced and not determined by science. The <span class=""highlight"">IPCC</span> has left judgment to policy makers for this reason. Others cited <span class=""highlight"">IPCC</span> projections to suggest that decision making is political and said everyday political or economic decision making is based on incomplete information."
co2|emission|350 ppm|emissions scenarios|qelros|binding commitments,"On <span class=""highlight"">legally binding</span> objectives, discussants preferred, _inter alia_<w0>, indicative targets with review mechanisms. On the question of whether obligations to attain <span class=""highlight"">QELROs</span> should be single- or multi-party, discussants agreed that single party obligations are the more realistic. There was also substantial agreement that immediate action to reduce <span class=""highlight"">emissions</span> would lessen the magnitude of future corrections necessary to stabilize the climate. A number of discussants suggested setting 2005 as a short-term <span class=""highlight"">emissions</span> target. One NGO advocated a reduction <span class=""highlight"">scenario</span> of <span class=""highlight"">350 ppmv</span> <span class=""highlight"">CO2</span> over a 50 year time scale, based on a correlation with violent <span class=""highlight"">storm</span> activity.</w0>"
baselines|models|qelros|emissions trading,"Considering differentiation among Annex I Parties, all discussants agreed that recognizing differentiation and <span class=""highlight"">equity</span> was essential to achieving <span class=""highlight"">QELROs</span>. One called for flat rate reduction, however most recognized differentiated effects on national economies as a result of climate policy. Given the complexity of <span class=""highlight"">modelling</span> these effects, one discussant suggested having Parties establish <span class=""highlight"">baseline</span> <span class=""highlight"">emissions</span> then calculate agreed percentage reductions on a Party-by- Party basis. A proposal to combine the two strategies, commencing with a flat rate reduction to meet short term objectives, followed by a global <span class=""highlight"">emissions</span> trading regime, was met with some enthusiasm."
energy efficiency|energy|industry|business,"<span class=""highlight"">OPEC</span> stated that the <span class=""highlight"">IPCC</span> Â“broke the rulesÂ” by implying consensus among scientists in its conclusions. He called for full <span class=""highlight"">compensation</span> for any economic damage arising from the implementation of the FCCC. NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF REGULATORY UTILITY COMMISSIONERS urged the Parties to encourage participation of all stakeholders and proceed cautiously on any new aims that would place undue cost burdens on utility customers. <span class=""highlight"">BUSINESS</span> COUNCIL FOR A SUSTAINABLE <span class=""highlight"">ENERGY</span> FUTURE suggested that Parties disseminate information on <span class=""highlight"">energy</span> efficiency, and consider new approaches to <span class=""highlight"">emissions</span> trading. A <span class=""highlight"">BUSINESS</span> NGO representative stated that <span class=""highlight"">business</span> and <span class=""highlight"">industry</span> involvement and all-Party participation are critical to implementation."
technology|technology transfer,"The Chair reported on Agenda Item 6 (<span class=""highlight"">development</span> and transfer of <span class=""highlight"">technology</span>), noting that the issue is a shared responsibility of SBSTA and SBI, and that SBI will continue to take SBSTAÂ’s views on the subject through an open-ended joint working group. Draft recommendations on Agenda Item 4(a) (Annex I communications) were also distributed and will be considered on Monday when they are also available in English. On the     roster of experts, the G-77/CHINA noted the need to include experts from developing countries and sought full transparency. He said experts should be strictly technical as opposed to political."
business,"NGO reaction varied to news that the Ministerial Round Table will remain closed to observers and the press. Some <span class=""highlight"">business</span> NGOs expressed mild concern that the Round Table, which will be opened to all heads of delegations regardless of rank, will result in a _de facto_ Plenary with no opportunity for outside input. Many environmental NGOs said they had not sought entry, in hopes a closed door session would produce tangible progress. Some NGOs of both camps voiced concern on setting a precedent."
technology|technology transfer,"SUBSIDIARY BODY ON IMPLEMENTATION:   SBI contact groups will meet on <span class=""highlight"">technology</span> transfer (10:00 a.m., chaired by Manuel Dengo, Costa Rica), <span class=""highlight"">GEF</span> communications (11:00 a.m., John Ashe, Antigua and Barbuda) and Annex I communications (3:00 a.m., John Drexhage, Canada). Check the board for room assignments."
fuel|fossil fuels|models|adaptive capacity|inaction|innovation,"Responses can stimulate technological <span class=""highlight"">innovation</span>, increasing economic and welfare gains. They also discussed: the limitations of economic <span class=""highlight"">modeling</span>; consideration of the costs of <span class=""highlight"">inaction</span> including non-economic implications; and how flexible and <span class=""highlight"">adaptive</span> economies in fossil <span class=""highlight"">fuel</span> importing countries may experience positive impacts."
carbon tax|models|inaction|industry,"The participants then considered the differential benefit/cost ratio of action vs. <span class=""highlight"">inaction</span> to implement the <span class=""highlight"">Berlin Mandate</span>. There was general agreement that imposing only Â“<span class=""highlight"">punitive</span>Â” measures such as <span class=""highlight"">carbon taxes</span> would have a disproportionate effect on developing country economies, especially those dependent upon petroleum. One <span class=""highlight"">industry</span> representative stated that economic <span class=""highlight"">models</span> predict a negative but minimal initial impact of <span class=""highlight"">emissions</span> limitations, reducing growth by about 0.5%."
innovation,"Several speakers suggested that the process of <span class=""highlight"">reducing emissions could build a new base for global economic growth inclusive of developing countries. Another participant specifically referred to flexible market-based policies allowing maximum innovation, though many emphasized fairness and common but differentiated responsibility.</span>"
business,"During subsequent discussion, it was stated that a study of the benefit/cost ratio over 20 years of the US Clean Air Act had yielded a figure of greater than 16 to 1. Another speaker pointed out that, despite this, there was substantial opposition from <span class=""highlight"">business</span> to the renewal of the law. Other participants discussed: using competitiveness to disseminate <span class=""highlight"">new technologies</span>; Annex 1 countries with links to Pacific territories should note the <span class=""highlight"">impact of climate change</span> on their regional interests."
eit|base year|economies in transition,"Several pending items were considered and the Chair reminded SBSTA of the need to achieve consensus on remaining items by WednesdayÂ’s Plenary. The Secretariat read the draft text and conclusions on Agenda Item 5(d) (activities <span class=""highlight"">implemented jointly</span>). Both were adopted without amendment. On Agenda Item 4(a) (Annex I communications), some amendments were proposed for the guidelines for the preparation of national communications. POLAND proposed that Parties with <span class=""highlight"">economies in transition</span> present <span class=""highlight"">emission</span> level projections from Â“<span class=""highlight"">base years</span>Â” rather than 1990."
eit|economies in transition|technology|technology transfer,"Regarding the draft decision on Annex I communications, POLAND sought clarification on the SBIÂ’s role in dealing with Parties with <span class=""highlight"">economies in transition</span>. The Chair noted that this was an issue to be determined by SBI not SBSTA. VENEZUELA and BURKINA FASO expressed concern about a tandem review process where both SBSTA and SBI review the joint contact groupsÂ’ guidelines and decisions. The Chair stated this could not be avoided and that each subsidiary body was empowered only to adopt those provisions it would take part in administering. On Agenda Item 9 (report to the COP), he said that he will present general comments on SBSTAÂ’s work on any unresolved items. SBSTA was then adjourned until 5:00 p.m. to allow for meetings of contact groups on the roster of experts, the <span class=""highlight"">development</span> and transfer of <span class=""highlight"">technology</span>, use of scientific assessments, and non-Annex I communications."
water resources|water|health|agriculture,"Following a brief consultation with the G-77/CHINA, Saudi Arabia and the EU, the Chair amended a reference to the <span class=""highlight"">SAR</span> as Â“an assessment,Â” rather than a Â“clear indicationÂ” of the likelihood of climate change. He added a sentence noting large cost differentials of reducing GHGs among countries, and inserted a reference to areas such as <span class=""highlight"">agriculture</span>, <span class=""highlight"">water</span> resources and human <span class=""highlight"">health</span> in regard to the socio-<span class=""highlight"">economic impacts</span> on developing countries. The US, the MARSHALL ISLANDS, the EU, CANADA, NORWAY, JAPAN and AOSIS voiced concern that the text was not balanced and asked that their objection be noted on the record. The Chair stated it was Â“uselessÂ” to continue deliberations on this issue."
qelros,"The Chair commenced by summarizing previous discussion on Agenda Item 5 (possible features of a protocol or other instrument), stating that: the form of the legal instrument should flow from its substance; the new instrument should be served by existing institutions; and many Parties supported a simple protocol which was open to all FCCC Parties and was flexible. Chairs of the Round Table discussions on <span class=""highlight"">Policies and Measures</span>, and on <span class=""highlight"">QELROs</span>, then gave their summaries."
eit|economies in transition,"Following this, Ian Pickard (UK), chair of the Annex I Expert Group, presented a summary (FCCC/AGBM/1996/Misc.1/ Add.2) of a study entitled Â“<span class=""highlight"">Policies and Measures</span> for Possible Common ActionÂ”. The report differentiates between Annex I developed countries and those with <span class=""highlight"">economies in transition</span>."
greenhouse gas emissions|emission|qelros,"The Chair then invited general comments on <span class=""highlight"">policies and measures</span> and <span class=""highlight"">QELROs</span>. ROMANIA agreed with the concept of differentiated commitments but cautioned against using 1990 data for his country because <span class=""highlight"">GHG emissions decreased 20-40% due to major political changes. BANGLADESH emphasized developed countriesÂ’ obligations to reduce GHG emissions.</span>"
greenhouse gas emissions|reducing emissions|emission,"The EU described previous work on <span class=""highlight"">policies and measures</span> for a protocol, including impacts on international competitiveness. He called the <span class=""highlight"">SAR</span> of the <span class=""highlight"">IPCC</span> the Â“principal reference reportÂ” for global <span class=""highlight"">emissions</span> reduction objectives. The EU prefers to see <span class=""highlight"">GHG emissions levels below 550 ppmv, and it is essential for Parties to bring specific proposals for a legally binding instrument to the table at AGBM-5.</span>"
reducing emissions|greenhouse gas emissions|emission,"AUSTRALIA cautioned that the potential to limit <span class=""highlight"">GHG emissions without seriously undermining economic growth is limited. She stated that flat emissions reductions</span> are not environmentally- or cost-effective or equitable. Calling differentiation Â“centralÂ”, she suggested three illustrative approaches to differentiation, with <span class=""highlight"">emissions</span> reductions based on: projected <span class=""highlight"">emissions</span> trends; factors such as population growth; and considerations embodied in trade."
binding commitments|flexibility,"NORWAY favored <span class=""highlight"">binding commitments</span> that are differentiated, cost-effective, equitable and verifiable. The US said proposals will have to be concluded early in 1997 for adoption at COP-3. The REPUBLIC OF KOREA and KUWAIT called for <span class=""highlight"">equity</span> and fair burden sharing. NEW ZEALAND said <span class=""highlight"">flexibility</span> will be a key factor in AGBM process and outcomes. JAPAN said it is essential to allow each Party to choose <span class=""highlight"">policies and measures</span>."
qelros,"SWITZERLAND, supported by MALI, called for a dynamic approach and proposed three categories of commitment. CANADA said <span class=""highlight"">policies and measures</span> should reinforce a positive relationship between the economy and the environment. The RUSSIAN FEDERATION said <span class=""highlight"">policies and measures</span> must acknowledge a right to sustainable <span class=""highlight"">development</span>. AOSIS, supported by the PHILIPPINES and the MALDIVES, said the <span class=""highlight"">SAR</span> is sufficient to allow agreement on <span class=""highlight"">QELROs</span>."
qelros|binding commitments,"URUGUAY said measures must be incumbent on Parties beyond their contamination threshold. The NETHERLANDS underscored support for policies based on a view that a temperature increase exceeding 2 degrees is not tolerable. The PHILIPPINES stated that <span class=""highlight"">QELROs</span> should be <span class=""highlight"">legally binding</span>."
funding|gef,"Contact groups of the SBI met today. Among the issues discussed was communications from non-Annex I Parties. According to some delegates, developing countries objected to the suggestion that non-Annex I national reports include information on mitigation measures. This opposition, it was reported, is linked to objections to <span class=""highlight"">funding</span> GHG mitigation projects by the <span class=""highlight"">Global Environment Facility</span>. Mitigation, it was claimed, should be first pursued by developed countries."
uncertainties|qelros|base year|flexibility,"The Chair summarized discussion under the agenda item. He regretted that very little was done to narrow down <span class=""highlight"">policies and measures</span> issues. Outstanding issues on <span class=""highlight"">QELROs</span> include <span class=""highlight"">emission</span> levels, whether commitments should be binding, multiparty obligations, and base and target years. Some delegations believe the <span class=""highlight"">SAR</span> provides the basis for ambitious <span class=""highlight"">QELROs</span>. Several supported <span class=""highlight"">QELROs</span> in the <span class=""highlight"">AOSIS protocol</span>. <span class=""highlight"">Uncertainties</span> remain about costs and impacts of GHG reductions. A number stressed <span class=""highlight"">flexibility</span> and differentiation of commitments, possibly including different <span class=""highlight"">base years</span> to take account of <span class=""highlight"">national circumstances</span>. Some questioned the possibility of agreeing differentiated policies in time. The Chair will include a request for a follow-up meeting and the view that non-action is not an option in his report. SAUDI ARABIA requested that an assessment of impacts be annexed to a protocol. Reports from the three Round Table Chairs will be annexed to the Report of the AGBM Session."
policies and measures|qelros,"The AGBM Chair invited comments on his Draft Conclusions (FCCC/AGBM/1996/L.2). The EU and Saudi Arabia objected to a reference to an Â“equationÂ” to express linkage between <span class=""highlight"">policies and measures</span> and <span class=""highlight"">QELROs</span>. In a paragraph on elaboration of <span class=""highlight"">policies and measures</span> the US, supported by AUSTRALIA, objected to the inclusion of Â“a menu approach.Â” FRANCE qualified a reference to harmonized <span class=""highlight"">policies and measures</span> by prefacing the reference with Â“and/orÂ”. GERMANY replaced mandatory with Â“requiredÂ” approach to <span class=""highlight"">policies and measures</span>. AUSTRALIA incorporated sentences from the fourth paragraph, which notes the argument that no set of <span class=""highlight"">policies and measures</span> may be appropriate for all Annex I Parties and concerns about competition."
policies and measures|sink,"On the paragraph concerning the adoption of <span class=""highlight"">policies and measures</span>, SAUDI ARABIA called for language noting the need for further studies. The EU proposed that action be Â“coordinatedÂ” rather than Â“common or harmonizedÂ”. KUWAIT said <span class=""highlight"">policies and measures</span> should be assessed in terms of their Â“economicÂ” costs and their impact on developing countries. GERMANY and the US recommended that Â“environmentalÂ” costs and benefits be considered and EGYPT said their role in enhancing carbon <span class=""highlight"">sinks</span> should also be noted. The paragraph was adopted to reflect that several criteria were identified for assessing <span class=""highlight"">policies and measures</span> including their: potential to limit <span class=""highlight"">GHG emissions and enhance carbon sinks; economic costs and benefits; long and short term impact on economic growth in developing countries; and political feasibility as well as the need for coordinated action.</span>"
qelros,"In a paragraph dealing with outstanding issues on <span class=""highlight"">QELROs</span>, KENYA, supported by the US, FRANCE and GERMANY, noted that it was left open whether the level of <span class=""highlight"">emission</span> reductions should be politically or scientifically based. KUWAIT proposed that <span class=""highlight"">QELROs</span>Â’ impact on the economic and social structure of developing countries as well as their effect on atmospheric GHG concentrations be recognized. These proposals were adopted."
technology|technology transfer,"On the <span class=""highlight"">development</span> and transfer of <span class=""highlight"">technology</span> and the establishment of a roster of experts, the Chair stated that while both issues were to be resolved jointly between the subsidiary bodies, the SBI will manage their remaining progress, given the technical nature of the issues. The Chair proposed a revised draft decision on use of the <span class=""highlight"">SAR</span>. The decision notes the PartiesÂ’ differing opinions on the <span class=""highlight"">SAR</span> and SBSTAÂ’s inability to achieve consensus on the issue. A final decision should be left to the COP."
funding,"SBSTA also considered the draft decisions of the contact group on communications from non-Annex I Parties, which incorporates several additional responsibilities. BRAZIL said that the contact group decided that its work would not be prejudiced by the COPÂ’s decision on guidelines for initial communications on the abatement of <span class=""highlight"">emissions</span>. Several delegations, including CHINA, KUWAIT, INDIA, COSTA RICA, the PHILIPPINES, CANADA, the US and JAPAN, endorsed the decisions and acknowledged the cooperative efforts of non-Annex I Parties. The EU recognized the added responsibilities for non-Annex I Parties. The PHILIPPINES also linked the expanded commitments of non-Annex I Parties to their potential role in obtaining <span class=""highlight"">funding</span>."
technology|environmentallyâ­sound technology|technology transfer,"SBI met to consider a number of draft decisions negotiated in closed contact groups. The draft decision on Agenda Item 3(b) (non-Annex I communications) addresses assistance to developing country Parties in preparing initial communications, and in its Annex lists guidelines for the preparation of these reports. The draft decision was adopted. The draft decision on Agenda Item 5 (<span class=""highlight"">technology</span> transfer) addresses transfer of environmentally- sound <span class=""highlight"">technology</span> (<span class=""highlight"">EST</span>) and calls for measures such as reports, workshops and a roster of experts to expedite this. The draft decision was adopted."
gef|full costs|private sector|business,"The session then adopted a draft decision on Agenda Item 6 (activities <span class=""highlight"">implemented jointly</span>), which is also on the agenda of SBSTA and had been negotiated by that body. The WORLD <span class=""highlight"">BUSINESS</span> COUNCIL FOR SUSTAINABLE <span class=""highlight"">DEVELOPMENT</span> underscored the role of the <span class=""highlight"">private sector</span> in <span class=""highlight"">AIJ</span> for the transfer of ESTs. The draft decison on Agenda Item 4(a)(i) (guidance to the <span class=""highlight"">GEF</span>) emphasizes provision of agreed <span class=""highlight"">full costs</span> by the <span class=""highlight"">GEF</span> for preparation of national communications by non-Annex I Parties. The draft decision was adopted. The PHILIPPINES emphasized the paragraph calling on non-Annex I Parties to follow guidelines and format adopted by COP-2. The US supported this and highlighted other guidelines for the <span class=""highlight"">GEF</span> as well."
annex i national communications,"Delegates also considered a recommendation on the volume of documentation. On Agenda Item 3(a) (<span class=""highlight"">Annex I national communications</span>), the Chair of the contact group presented the draft conclusions of SBI-3 and a draft decision to be submitted by the Chair. KUWAIT, OMAN and SAUDI ARABIA requested more time for consideration. The Chair reminded delegates that there had been many consultations on this item and the conclusions and decision were adopted. SBI also accepted the draft decision on its programme of work. On Agenda Item 5 (a) (implementation of Article 4), delegates recommended that COP refer review until COP-3. Delegates also accepted the draft report of SBI-3 (FCCC/SBI/1996/L.3)."
small island|vulnerable,"Some delegations are reported to have expressed interest in supporting a new NGO initiative that will highlight the concerns of both <span class=""highlight"">vulnerable</span> and <span class=""highlight"">low island states</span>. The group will combine demands for Â“contractionÂ” (60% reduction of global fossil fusel use within a given time-frame) and Â“convergenceÂ” (an <span class=""highlight"">equity</span> principle based on convergence of above-par and below-par <span class=""highlight"">per capita</span> <span class=""highlight"">consumption</span> of fossil-carbon)."
funding|gef,"A contact group of the SBI failed to agree on a draft decision, SBI Agenda Item 4(a)(ii), defining the Annex to the Memorandum of Understanding between the COP and the <span class=""highlight"">GEF</span> Council. The Annex is intended to specify <span class=""highlight"">funding</span> necessary to implement the FCCC. According to observers, a compromise measure requesting the COP to work out <span class=""highlight"">funding</span> requirements in consultation with the <span class=""highlight"">GEF</span> was rejected. The matter will be taken up by the Bureau."
co2|1990 levels|emission,"SWITZERLAND: Ruth Dreifuss, Federal Councillor and Head, Federal Department of the Interior, recommended that the COP endorse the <span class=""highlight"">SAR</span> and invited countries whose economic <span class=""highlight"">development</span> is sufficient to join the OECD to voluntarily fulfill Annex I responsibilities. The Swiss GHG inventory indicates that <span class=""highlight"">carbon dioxide</span> <span class=""highlight"">emissions</span> may stabilize at <span class=""highlight"">1990 levels</span> by 2000."
gef|policies and measures|qelros,"The G-77/CHINA: Manuel Dengo, Ambassador of Costa Rica to the United Nations, said developed country Parties must strengthen their commitments in Articles 4.2 (a) and (b), including elaboration of <span class=""highlight"">policies and measures</span> and <span class=""highlight"">QELROs</span> with specified time frames. They are setting a bad precedent by evading responsibilities. The <span class=""highlight"">GEF</span>Â’s actions depend on decisions of the COP and not the reverse."
1990 levels|emission|co2,"The EU: Brendan Howlin, Minister for the Environment of Ireland, reaffirmed the EUÂ’s commitment to an ambitious outcome to the <span class=""highlight"">Berlin Mandate</span>. The EU is on course to return <span class=""highlight"">CO2</span> <span class=""highlight"">emissions</span> to <span class=""highlight"">1990 levels</span> by 2000. <span class=""highlight"">Carbon dioxide</span> concentration levels lower than 550 parts per million should guide global efforts. He called for a ministerial declaration that endorses the <span class=""highlight"">SAR</span> and the <span class=""highlight"">precautionary principle</span>, calls for enhanced implementation, and invites new proposals on the <span class=""highlight"">Berlin Mandate</span> process, which must be accelerated."
eit|economies in transition,"POLAND: Stanislaw Zelichowski, Minister of Environmental Protection, said reduced <span class=""highlight"">emission</span> levels by <span class=""highlight"">economies in transition</span> helped to offset slight increases by OECD country Parties. Some countries may be obliged to increase GHGs to pursue their right to economic and social <span class=""highlight"">development</span>."
emission|co2,"AUSTRALIA: Robert Hill, Minister of the Environment, voiced his commitment to fulfilling his obligations under the FCCC and acknowledged the importance of the <span class=""highlight"">SAR</span>. He said it would be premature to establish a particular point at which levels of GHGs become dangerous. He supported the reduction of <span class=""highlight"">CO2</span> <span class=""highlight"">emissions</span> under the <span class=""highlight"">precautionary principle</span>, the enhancement of <span class=""highlight"">carbon sinks, the cultivation of AIJ programs and a cooperative and equitable approach.</span>"
economies in transition|flexibility|binding commitments|eit,"GERMANY: Angela Merkel, Federal Minister for the Environment, Nature Conservation and <span class=""highlight"">Nuclear</span> Safety, said the <span class=""highlight"">SAR</span> confirms the need for more intensive action. The goals of the FCCC can only be achieved through <span class=""highlight"">international cooperation</span> that recognizes PartiesÂ’ Â“common but differentiatedÂ” responsibilities. She stressed the need for <span class=""highlight"">flexibility</span>, particularly for <span class=""highlight"">economies in transition</span>, as well as legally <span class=""highlight"">binding commitments</span> for <span class=""highlight"">policies and measures</span>, noting that some measures will only be effective if harmonized among Annex I countries."
environmentallyâ­sound technology,"JAPAN: Sukio Iwadare, Minister of State, Director General of the Environment Agency, urged the COP to shift its emphasis from analysis and assessment to negotiation by consolidating the points and proposals. He called for the formulation of a legal instrument that reflects: precautionary measures; environmental effectiveness; equitable and efficient distribution of policy efforts; positive direction; creation of a foundation for global measures; and the active <span class=""highlight"">development</span> and transfer of <span class=""highlight"">clean technologies</span>."

He called on Annex I countries to increase their efforts to reduce GHG emissions to levels stipulated in the FCCC and urged the COP to adopt its rules of procedure. He welcomed AIJ on a voluntary basis in accordance with the Berlin Mandate, assistance with human resource development and national capacity building, and equitable sharing of benefits and differentiated responsibilities under the Convention.</span>"
uncertainties|inaction|energy efficiency|energy|environmentallyâ­sound technology|industry,"CANADA: Sergio Marchi, Minister of the Environment, strongly supported the <span class=""highlight"">SAR</span> as a basis for urgent action, noting that <span class=""highlight"">uncertainties</span> regarding the rate and level of climate change are not grounds for <span class=""highlight"">inaction</span>. He said countries need to work Â“harder, faster and smarterÂ” and encouraged the <span class=""highlight"">development</span> and use of <span class=""highlight"">clean technologies</span>, projects aimed at <span class=""highlight"">energy</span> efficiency and the involvement of governments, international institutions, <span class=""highlight"">industry</span> and NGOs in an open and transparent process. He called for the establishment of targets for the year 2000 and beyond."
transport|emission|co2|energy|industry,"SWEDEN: Anna Lindh, Minister of the Environment, said a continued strategy for reducing <span class=""highlight"">CO2</span> <span class=""highlight"">emissions</span> should include concrete technical measures in a protocol and called for wise transformation of <span class=""highlight"">industrial processes</span>, <span class=""highlight"">energy</span> systems and <span class=""highlight"">transport</span> patterns. She also focused on economic instruments to promote cost-effective measures and noted SwedenÂ’s positive experiences with environmental taxes. She recommended harmonized <span class=""highlight"">taxation on CO2 emissions as an effective measure.</span>"
gef|funding,"GHANA: Sam P. Yalley, Deputy Minister of the Environment, Science and <span class=""highlight"">Technology</span>, noted that the anticipated <span class=""highlight"">impact of climate change</span> will be irreversible in his country. Although Ghana has not prepared a national communication, it has prepared an inventory of GHGs and has initiated Â“no regretsÂ” measures. He highlighted the slowness of the process and called for expeditious <span class=""highlight"">funding</span> from the <span class=""highlight"">GEF</span>. He expressed strong concern regarding attempts to sway delegates from taking measures recommended by the <span class=""highlight"">IPCC</span>, particularly those who based their arguments on <span class=""highlight"">economic losses</span>."
fuel|fossil fuels|technology|energy|environmentallyâ­sound technology,"The UK: John Gummer, Secretary of State for the Environment, noted that in Rio developed countries agreed that they had enjoyed the benefits of <span class=""highlight"">development</span>, and must now shoulder the burden. Many will not make their <span class=""highlight"">emission</span> targets. He disagreed with calls for a long-term GHG regime and said no developed country can avoid taking action now. Developed countries must help by exporting only clean <span class=""highlight"">technology</span>. He called for removing subsidies on the use of <span class=""highlight"">fossil fuels</span>, introducing competitiveness into <span class=""highlight"">energy</span> markets, increasing road <span class=""highlight"">fuel</span> duties, improving <span class=""highlight"">fuel</span> efficiency in cars, increasing <span class=""highlight"">tax on aviation</span> <span class=""highlight"">fuel</span> by removing the present exemption and improving domestic efficiency standards. He noted that some of the most inefficient offices are owned by the governments who talk the most about climate change."
investment|energy,"DENMARK: Svend Auken, Minister for the Environment and <span class=""highlight"">Energy</span>, contrasted the need for reductions and the forecast for <span class=""highlight"">energy</span> needs for the coming years and noted that even the OECD countries will experience substantial growth. He supported coordinated measures in taxation. He noted that there will be an enormous volume of <span class=""highlight"">investment</span> in the <span class=""highlight"">energy</span> sector and <span class=""highlight"">AIJ</span> must be truly additional to this <span class=""highlight"">investment</span>. <span class=""highlight"">AIJ</span> must not be a loophole for subsidizing <span class=""highlight"">energy</span> exports to developing countries, not a Â“sorry excuseÂ” for postponing actions needed in developed countries."
fuel,"MINISTERIAL SEGMENT:   Ruth Dreifuss (Switzerland), Chair of the Ministerial Round Table, noted that a large majority of ministers had endorsed the results of the <span class=""highlight"">SAR</span> and intended it as a basis for action, though political action is needed for setting <span class=""highlight"">emission</span> limits. She highlighted discussion at the Round Table session on: the concern of <span class=""highlight"">SIDS</span> and African countries over insufficient resources; the primary role of developed countries in GHG mitigation; the requirement for supplementary commitments; the concern of <span class=""highlight"">oil</span>-producing countries about effects on their economies; and the need to consider a text of a protocol at COP-3."
carbon tax|industry,"NORWAY: Bernt Bull, Ministry of Environment, outlined a legally-binding commitment that: recognizes different <span class=""highlight"">industry</span> structures; is equitable and verifiable; is based on <span class=""highlight"">equity</span>, not a flat rate reduction; and utilizes <span class=""highlight"">fiscal measures</span>, e.g. <span class=""highlight"">carbon taxes</span>."

Chub, Minister, Chief of the Main Administration of Hydrometeorology, highlighted the changing <span class=""highlight"">water</span> balance of the Aral Sea region, calling for <span class=""highlight"">energy</span> efficient <span class=""highlight"">technology</span> and regional cooperation."
base year,"BULGARIA: Yontcho Pelovski, Deputy Minister of the Environment, described national measures to reduce <span class=""highlight"">GHG emissions. The first national communication utilizes 1988 rather than 1990 base year data, due to a radical drop in production in 1990 following political changes.</span>"
co2|emission,"FRANCE: Pierre Chemillier spoke on behalf of Corinne Lepage, Minister of the Environment, calling it a duty to adopt the <span class=""highlight"">precautionary principle</span>. Many GHG measures require <span class=""highlight"">binding international commitments</span>. She called for a tax on <span class=""highlight"">CO2</span> <span class=""highlight"">emissions</span> and a simple differentiation mechanism."
technology transfer|technology|energy|energy efficiency,"ROMANIA: Ioan Jelev, Department of the Environment, Secretary of State, supported <span class=""highlight"">GHG emission reductions through improved energy efficiency and the enhancement of human resources, finance mechanisms, technology transfer</span> and <span class=""highlight"">AIJ</span>."

flexibility|binding commitments|emissions trading,"The US said she Â“wholeheartedlyÂ” endorses the Declaration, which focuses on three critical points: the need to move forward on the basis of new and compelling scientific evidence; the need to focus on legally <span class=""highlight"">binding targets</span> as the next step; and the need to rapidly move the process forward to complete its critical work by COP-3. She said the one point not specified was that the negotiated outcome must ensure maximum national <span class=""highlight"">flexibility</span> for all Parties to implement their medium-term legally <span class=""highlight"">binding commitments</span>. There is also a need to work toward a longer term concentration goal. To this end, the inclusion of <span class=""highlight"">AIJ</span> on a global basis and international <span class=""highlight"">emissions</span> trading must be part of any future regime. The US believes these views are fully reflected in the Declaration."
water|binding commitments|emissions trading,"Two developments at COP-2, the US statement supporting a <span class=""highlight"">legally binding</span> agreement to reduce <span class=""highlight"">emissions</span> and the Ministerial Declaration, drew several reactions from participants. Regarding the US statement, one delegate expressed concern about the impact of a requirement for tradeable <span class=""highlight"">emission</span> permits on a <span class=""highlight"">binding agreemen</span>t. Another delegate mentioned that the <span class=""highlight"">AOSIS protocol</span>, and its targets, could be Â“dead in the <span class=""highlight"">water</span>Â”. Regarding the Declaration, one observer was surprised at the level of dissent, expressed in heated exchanges between some delegations and the COP officials, minutes before the Plenary was due to note the Declaration."

The informal exchange was designed to facilitate deliberations on the development of a compliance system under the Protocol. The workshop was organized by the Austrian Government, the FCCC Secretariat and the Co-Chairs of the Joint Working Group on Compliance (JWG). Ninety-seven participants attended the meeting, including experts and representatives from governments, UN agencies, intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations. Participants heard presentations from experts and discussed various issues related to compliance, including: compliance regimes under the Montreal Protocol, the Convention on Long-range Transboundary Air Pollution (LRTAP) and its protocols, the International Labour Organization (ILO) and the World Trade Organization (WTO); institutional issues such as facilitative and enforcement functions, eligibility to raise issues and information gathering; and issues related to the consequences of non-compliance. The JWGÂ’s Co-Chairs will prepare a non- paper on elements of a compliance system based on the workshop discussions to be presented to COP-5.

In this context, it was suggested that the subsidiary bodies continue to examine information needed to minimize the adverse social, environmental and <span class=""highlight"">economic impacts</span> of Annex I PartiesÂ’ response measures on developing countries, including: tax restructuring to reflect the carbon content of fuels; measures to discourage the production of <span class=""highlight"">fossil fuels</span> and <span class=""highlight"">nuclear</span> <span class=""highlight"">energy</span>; <span class=""highlight"">compensation</span>; and assistance to developing countries, including increasing <span class=""highlight"">investment</span>, to help them diversify their economies. Other participants said the <span class=""highlight"">uncertainties</span> associated with the impact of implementing response measures are such that consideration of specific actions is premature. They noted that such actions under the Protocol would be considered at the COP serving as the Meeting of the Parties to the Protocol at its first session (COP/MOP-1). They also recalled that <span class=""highlight"">compensation</span> was not provided for under the FCCC or the Protocol. Some participants stressed the need to identify and analyze initial actions to meet the specific needs and concerns of developing countries arising from the adverse <span class=""highlight"">effects of climate change</span> and the impact of response measures, including information on the possible use of insurance and other appropriate mechanisms.

The G-77/CHINA said any consideration of the <span class=""highlight"">LULUCF</span> process should begin after the release of the <span class=""highlight"">IPCC</span> Special Report. JAPAN, with AUSTRALIA, called for the establishment of a decision-making framework at COP-5. AUSTRALIA stressed that the key question is not Â“whetherÂ” but Â“howÂ” additional <span class=""highlight"">sink</span> activities could be included in the Protocol. CANADA said the decision-making framework should be based on consistency between the provisions of the <span class=""highlight"">Kyoto Protocol</span>."

The PHILIPPINES recommended that capacity building be Â“for,Â” Â“byÂ” and Â“inÂ” developing countries and said the <span class=""highlight"">GEF</span> initiative was the antithesis of capacity building. CANADA, supporting the <span class=""highlight"">GEF</span> initiative, urged the <span class=""highlight"">GEF</span> to further develop its interagency approach."
technology|technology transfer,"The G77/CHINA referred to its draft decision that, inter alia, requests the Secretariat to prepare a plan to facilitate capacity building for developing countries. He underscored the importance of workshops being undertaken with the participation of developing countries. The CENTRAL AFRICAN REPUBLIC highlighted the futility of short workshops, as developing countries needed continuous ones. The EU suggested: identifying non-Annex I PartiesÂ’ needs by analyzing their national communications; identifying existing capacities; agreeing on a process to ensure that priority areas receive appropriate support; and providing guidance for establishing an assessment of capacity- building activities on climate change. CANADA supported a coordinated response among existing efforts in capacity building and proposed three steps: assessment of needs; overview of actions currently undertaken by various actors; and definition of a clear scope for action. AUSTRALIA sought information from the Secretariat on current support for developing countries in order to identify gaps and needs for future work. NORWAY favored an integrated approach for the identification of needs. SWITZERLAND endorsed a practical approach focused on identifying appropriate needs in specific areas. The RUSSIAN FEDERATION offered <span class=""highlight"">technology</span> transfer assistance."
cdm,"On capacity building needs, the G77/CHINA referred to its draft decision calling on the COP to, _inter alia_: conduct capacity building activities; provide the necessary financial and technical support to strengthen national focal points; promote climate-related research and studies; and promote capacity building of national institutions and expertise. AUSTRALIA, CANADA, JAPAN and UZBEKISTAN said that capacity building was necessary to take full advantage of the clean <span class=""highlight"">development</span> mechanism (<span class=""highlight"">CDM</span>). The US highlighted the need for an integrated approach to all capacity-building efforts. CLIMATE ACTION NETWORK supported a <span class=""highlight"">bottom-up</span> approach to capacity building based on local and regional initiatives involving the NGO community, as many criteria for the mechanisms are still unknown, it.

AOSIS said <span class=""highlight"">carbon sequestration</span> projects may not guarantee measurable and long-term effects and expressed concern over the possible inclusion of <span class=""highlight"">sinks</span>. With the MARSHALL ISLANDS, BOTSWANA and SAMOA, he opposed linking <span class=""highlight"">AIJ</span> to the Protocol mechanisms. JAPAN, supported by the EU, said the experience gained is sufficient for a comprehensive review. With POLAND, he stressed that an <span class=""highlight"">AIJ</span> project should be eligible under <span class=""highlight"">joint implementation</span> (<span class=""highlight"">JI</span>) or <span class=""highlight"">CDM</span> if it meets the criteria for eligibility and if the Parties involved agree. The MARSHALL ISLANDS urged discontinuation of temporary carbon storage projects under <span class=""highlight"">AIJ</span>. The US proposed exploring the eligibility of <span class=""highlight"">AIJ</span> projects under <span class=""highlight"">CDM</span> or <span class=""highlight"">JI</span>."
industry,"Opposed by AOSIS, BOTSWANA and IRAN, the EU, with SWITZERLAND, proposed that <span class=""highlight"">AIJ</span> should be credited retroactively. She identified the lack of crediting and capacity in the host countries and high transaction costs for small projects as barriers in the <span class=""highlight"">pilot phase</span>. SWITZERLAND and AUSTRALIA said that without credit, <span class=""highlight"">industries</span> would be cautious about <span class=""highlight"">AIJ</span>."
gef|funding,"The REPUBLIC OF KOREA said that since most <span class=""highlight"">AIJ</span> projects are financed though official <span class=""highlight"">funds</span> like <span class=""highlight"">ODA</span> and the <span class=""highlight"">GEF</span>, credits certification should be treated carefully. The AFRICAN GROUP underscored the need to involve <span class=""highlight"">local communities</span> in the design and execution of such projects."
cdm,"The G-77/CHINA said a <span class=""highlight"">CDM</span> decision must precede decisions on other mechanisms. AUSTRALIA noted the need for considerable technical work prior to COP-6. The EU noted significant areas of convergence among Parties but said a ceiling on the use of mechanisms has to be defined. The US supported parallel progress on the mechanisms with priority given to the <span class=""highlight"">CDM</span>. With NORWAY and SWITZERLAND, he suggested refining the synthesis into a draft negotiating text. NORWAY further identified the need to decide on a work plan in the run-up to COP-6. AOSIS highlighted the need for the mechanisms to be based on sound environmental principles and, with VENEZUELA, called for adequate time for consideration. He added that AOSIS would not permit mechanisms that allow Annex I Parties to offload domestic responsibilities. UZBEKISTAN, with the RUSSIAN FEDERATION, sought clear definitions of core concepts. CHINA opposed taking a single decision on all mechanisms as this was not supported by the Protocol. He recommended that there be three distinct decisions on the mechanisms. SAUDI ARABIA stressed that progress on this issue is conditional on progress on other equally important issues. A contact group, to be chaired by Kok Kee Chow, was asked to revise and consolidate the views into a draft negotiating text and agree on a work plan in the run-up to COP-6. The G-77/CHINA said that the reference to the draft negotiating text was unwarranted at this stage."

AUSTRALIA, the US and the EU highlighted the potential role of the <span class=""highlight"">clean development mechanism</span> (<span class=""highlight"">CDM</span>) in <span class=""highlight"">technology</span> transfer. The PHILIPPINES, with SAUDI ARABIA and CHINA, stressed that <span class=""highlight"">technology</span> transfer was a commitment under the FCCC and opposed linking it to the <span class=""highlight"">CDM</span>. CHINA said <span class=""highlight"">technology</span> transfer under the Protocol should be additional to that under the FCCC. The PHILIPPINES called for information on <span class=""highlight"">technology</span> transfer activities in Annex-I communications. AOSIS stressed addressing <span class=""highlight"">adaptation technologies</span>. The G-77/CHINA called for a COP-5 decision on capacity building. SWITZERLAND underscored consideration of specific <span class=""highlight"">national circumstances</span>. The REPUBLIC OF KOREA noted the need to review the transfer of public-funded <span class=""highlight"">technology</span> in the consultative process.

compliance system|enforcement|facilitative branch,"The <span class=""highlight"">JWG</span> on compliance heard four diagrammatic submissions illustrating a <span class=""highlight"">compliance system</span>. The US said that its design for the <span class=""highlight"">compliance system</span> is focused on Protocol Article 3 (GHG reduction and limitation commitments) and provides for both facilitative and <span class=""highlight"">enforcement</span> functions to be dealt with ''by two different sets of people.'' She said the goal of <span class=""highlight"">enforcement</span> is to ensure compliance through <span class=""highlight"">binding consequences</span> that are known in advance. In presenting its preliminary views, JAPAN proposed a single <span class=""highlight"">compliance body</span> and outlined steps ranging from assistance to recommendations to be exhausted before the <span class=""highlight"">entry into force</span> of consequences. The EU explained that its <span class=""highlight"">compliance committee</span> would have a <span class=""highlight"">facilitative branch</span> and an <span class=""highlight"">enforcement</span> branch, with a possible referral from the former to the latter. Issues would be channeled automatically to the branches. SAMOA stressed two features of the AOSIS diagram: avoidance of polarization between the facilitative and <span class=""highlight"">enforcement</span> functions, since they overlap, and an eligibility committee responsible for the determination of mechanism eligibility. He added that an ad hoc appeal body would hear quasi-judicial appeals on the imposition of binding penalties."
compliance system|trigger,"On eligibility to raise issues, the UK explained that the mere provision of information would not Â“<span class=""highlight"">trigger</span>Â” the <span class=""highlight"">compliance procedure</span>, but that it would be triggered by whatever causes the <span class=""highlight"">compliance procedure</span> to start considering a claim. Many delegates agreed that a Party could raise an issue about its own compliance, and that a Party or group of Parties could raise an issue about another PartyÂ’s compliance. CANADA said sufficient evidence should be provided to support cases. IRAN said only a group of Parties could <span class=""highlight"">trigger</span> a case of another PartyÂ’s compliance. The EU, CANADA, CHINA, JAPAN, IRAN, SOUTH AFRICA and the US opposed a <span class=""highlight"">triggering</span> role for the Secretariat. Delegates emphasized its information gathering function and the need for it to preserve objectivity and neutrality."
compliance system|trigger|expert review,"Regarding the <span class=""highlight"">Expert Review</span> Teams (ERTs), the EU said the ERTsÂ’ reports would be automatically submitted to the <span class=""highlight"">compliance committee</span> through the Secretariat. CANADA said the reports were the factual basis that determined the need for further steps. CHINA, with IRAN, KUWAIT, BRAZIL and ARGENTINA said it was inappropriate to give ERTs, a simple fact finding body, a <span class=""highlight"">triggering</span> role. SOUTH AFRICA explained that doing so could endanger the objectivity of the ERTs. The US and AUSTRALIA suggested guidelines for a possible referral to the <span class=""highlight"">compliance body</span>."
compliance system|trigger,"On the role of the COP/MOP, many delegates said it should give policy guidance to the <span class=""highlight"">compliance body</span>. SWITZERLAND, the RUSSIAN FEDERATION and CHINA proposed that the COP/MOP should have a <span class=""highlight"">triggering</span> role as well as the competence to decide on the findings of the <span class=""highlight"">compliance body</span>. SOUTH AFRICA expressed concern about due process if the COP/MOP was given both these functions. BRAZIL suggested that the COP/MOP only take note of the <span class=""highlight"">compliance body</span> report. Several delegates said a <span class=""highlight"">triggering</span> role would delay and politicize the process. SAUDI ARABIA said the COP/MOP should play a role Â“at the beginning, at the end and in the middleÂ” of the compliance process."
compliance system|expert review,"On sources of information, AUSTRALIA and the US said that due process required the defending party to be able to present necessary information and rebut evidence against it. Parties suggested several sources of information, including: the <span class=""highlight"">expert review</span> teams; outside experts; and intergovernmental organizations. SAMOA suggested any source the <span class=""highlight"">compliance body</span> deemed appropriate, while IRAN said Parties should be the only source. BRAZIL said sources should bear responsibility for their information."

cdm,"_MECHANISMS: _Chair Chow (Malaysia) took the participants through the Synthesis of PartiesÂ’ Proposals on Mechanisms (FCCC/SB/1999/8). He highlighted certain sections, noted areas of convergence and divergence, and suggested issues for consideration. The EU, NORWAY and the US suggested ways of consolidating and tightening the text. On the <span class=""highlight"">CDM</span>, the G-77/CHINA pointed to deficiencies in the text, including the absence of a section on Ã¯Â¿Â½nature and scopeÃ¯Â¿Â½ and the lack of a determination of what the driving force of the <span class=""highlight"">CDM</span> should be. On a general note, SAUDI ARABIA reiterated its reservation on aiming for a draft negotiating text by SB-12, as this was premature. The G-77/CHINA said technical appendices complicate the issue and stressed the need to address the technical issues. He also noted the need for Parties to meet in their regional groups."

A number of participants criticized the rigid eligibility criteria by which the <span class=""highlight"">GEF</span> interprets and weights proposals submitted by countries as unrealistic, and said these criteria can delay the process of implementing national actions. While some felt that the problems arise from inadequate guidance given to the <span class=""highlight"">GEF</span> by the COP, others attributed them to difficulties in co-ordinating the interests and mandates of two intergovernmental bodies. In response to these concerns, a number of participants called for a country-led review of the <span class=""highlight"">GEF</span>Ã¯Â¿Â½s role so as to facilitate implementation of the FCCC, particularly by the <span class=""highlight"">least developed countries</span>."

SBSTA Chair Dovland (Norway) urged the Parties to intensify their efforts to reach agreement on these issues."
compliance system,"AUSTRALIA presented its diagrammatic submission on a <span class=""highlight"">compliance procedure</span> focused on Protocol Article 3.1 (greenhouse <span class=""highlight"">gas</span> reduction and limitation commitments). She highlighted that facilitation would be available on any issue relating to the target and that the outcome of the <span class=""highlight"">compliance procedure</span> would be a COP/MOP decision applying the negative consensus rule."
equitable geographic distribution|compliance system,"Delegates then addressed the structure of a <span class=""highlight"">compliance body</span>. On the nature of a <span class=""highlight"">compliance body</span>, a number of delegates said it should be a standing body in order to allow consistency and continuity in its practice, as well as build confidence in its work. On the frequency of the <span class=""highlight"">compliance body</span>Â’s meetings, AOSIS and SOUTH AFRICA said it would depend on the amount of work it had before it and that meetings should be held together with other meetings under the FCCC. The EU said meetings should be held regularly, and SWITZERLAND suggested it meet at least once a year, given the continuous work of the <span class=""highlight"">compliance body</span>. On the bodyÂ’s size and composition, a number of delegates suggested a small body composed of scientific, technical and legal experts appointed by governments yet acting in their personal capacity. They said the composition of the body should ensure <span class=""highlight"">equitable geographic distribution</span>. POLAND said there should be an equal number of Protocol Annex B and non-Annex B Parties, and AUSTRALIA, supported by the US, added that the composition would depend upon the article under review. SWITZERLAND, with SOUTH AFRICA, said it should be possible to call on outside experts. He added that additional Annex I PartiesÂ’ experts should be called on when considering Protocol Article 3. A number of delegates, opposed by SAUDI ARABIA, stressed the need for the body to have its own rules of procedure. The EU said these rules should be adopted by the body itself, while KUWAIT, BRAZIL and CHINA said the COP/MOP should adopt these rules."
compliance system,"On the relationship of the <span class=""highlight"">compliance system</span> with Protocol Article 19 (dispute settlement), several Parties said these two procedures should be kept separate. The US said it envisioned the <span class=""highlight"">compliance system</span> being structured in such a way that a Party would present information on non-compliance to the <span class=""highlight"">compliance committee</span>, which would follow-up on the matter. Within such a framework, the Party would decide whether it would raise a bilateral dispute under Article 19 or initiate the multilateral process under the <span class=""highlight"">compliance system</span>. The UAE said the suggestion by the US would cause confusion, as similar cases taken through Article 19 and the <span class=""highlight"">compliance system</span> would have differing results. NEW ZEALAND said the Article 19 process could be the basis for a final appeal procedure. The UK responded that a bilateral appeal could not flow from a multilateral process. He highlighted the need to determine whether the <span class=""highlight"">compliance system</span> or the dispute settlement process would take precedence where the two are in action simultaneously."

Delegates then heard presentations from the <span class=""highlight"">IPCC</span>, followed by a question-and-answer session. The <span class=""highlight"">IPCC</span> said, inter alia, that its <span class=""highlight"">Third Assessment Report</span> (<span class=""highlight"">TAR</span>) would provide more details on regional impacts and other issues relating to implementation of FCCC Articles 4.8 and 4.9. Concerning the impact of implementing response measures, he said that <span class=""highlight"">modeling</span> is purely speculative and that it was very difficult to predict changes in the price of <span class=""highlight"">oil</span> because of the many variables involved. He added that countries take actions that may counter an <span class=""highlight"">adverse effect</span>, but that these are seldom identified as Â“climate interventionsÂ” and are motivated by factors other than FCCC implementation."

eit|economies in transition,"_CAPACITY BUILDING: _ This contact group considered the Co-ChairsÂ’ draft proposal for a draft decision on capacity building for developing countries that was prepared on the basis of PartiesÂ’ comments on the G-77/CHINAÂ’s proposal. Some delegates noted that the revised document did not fully take account of their submission. There was disagreement on whether the draft decision should address countries with <span class=""highlight"">economies in transition</span>. The group discussed preambular paragraphs that: recognize the importance of taking stock of existing capacity-building activities, acknowledge that, though work has begun, substantial work remains to be done; recognize the main constraints to implementing the FCCC in developing countries; underline that capacity- building must be country driven in accordance with the FCCC provisions; and emphasize the continuous nature of the capacity-building process."

On reporting formats, some delegates noted that guidelines for the provision of data relating to Article 3.3 (net changes in <span class=""highlight"">GHG emissions and removals) were already provided for by the IPCC 1996 guidelines and said Parties should abide by them. Others considered that additional and more specific data and information were needed. Timing, application and criteria for data under Articles 3.3 and 3.4 (additional human-induced activities relating to changes in emissions and removals) and 3.7 (assigned amounts and LULUCF as a net source of emissions) were discussed. The group identified transparency, verifiability, accounting for uncertainties and attribution as criteria under Articles 3.4 and attempted to identify additional criteria including: measurability; permanence; prevention of perverse incentives; avoidance of double accounting; symmetry; conformity with the FCCC, the Protocol and other conventions; and the Â“leakage effect.Â”</span>"

Some participants feel that hesitation on the part of some Annex I Parties to provide country-specific data stems from a reluctance to reveal the implications of Article 3.4 activities (such as <span class=""highlight"">agriculture</span> and <span class=""highlight"">land-use</span> change) on the amount of their overall <span class=""highlight"">emissions</span> and their ability to meet their Protocol targets. Others are of the view that the more data available, the greater the prospects for informed decision-making about <span class=""highlight"">sinks</span>. The concern is that this controversy could have an impact on the timing of a conclusive decision on <span class=""highlight"">LULUCF</span>, and therefore the <span class=""highlight"">entry into force</span> of the Protocol."

Several delegates said the draft conclusions provided a useful text to work on. SAUDI ARABIA, CHINA, the US, NIGERIA and BRAZIL said the paper developed by the Co-Chairs should be based on more sources of information. Delegates suggested that additional sources of information could be drawn from existing and further submissions by Parties, as well as discussions held during the session of the <span class=""highlight"">JWG</span> and during a possible forthcoming workshop. CHINA, IRAN and SAUDI ARABIA, opposed by the EU and AUSTRALIA, suggested that the paper serve as a basis for Â“considerationÂ” of compliance. NIGERIA added that nothing in the <span class=""highlight"">Buenos Aires Plan of Action</span> (BAPA) required the <span class=""highlight"">JWG</span> to finish its work by COP-6.

intergovernmental panel on climate change|lulucf|additional activities,"_LULUCF:_ Co-Chairs Thorgeirsson (Iceland) and Gwage (Uganda) informed the group of a draft decision they had prepared on <span class=""highlight"">LULUCF</span>-related methodological issues, including aspects relating to submissions by Parties on: definitions and activities on Protocol Article 3.3 (net changes in <span class=""highlight"">emissions</span> and removals); a list of activities that each individual Party is seeking to include under Article 3.4 (additional human-induced activities relating to changes in <span class=""highlight"">emissions</span> and removals); views on possible modalities, rules and guidelines on <span class=""highlight"">additional activities</span> under Protocol Article 3.4; and a request for the Secretariat to compile a list of guiding principles and criteria for the identification and selection of <span class=""highlight"">additional activities</span> under Article 3.4. The G-77/CHINA said it had prepared a draft decision covering similar aspects and including others such as guidance on the scope of the workshop on the <span class=""highlight"">IPCC</span> Special Report. Many delegations noted similarities between the two texts, and agreed to follow the sequencing of paragraphs in the G-77/CHINA proposal as a basis for discussions. The group read through the text and established a drafting group to work on it. Differing views focused on, inter alia: the sequence of activities in the lead-up to SBSTA-12 and how they interrelate; presentation and transmission of the <span class=""highlight"">IPCC</span> Special Report to SBSTA-12; timing for submissions and consideration of criteria and guiding principles for data on <span class=""highlight"">additional activities</span>; timing for submissions and proposals for definitions on activities under Article 3.3; and timing for and types of country-specific data. The contact group reconvened to consider progress made by the drafting group, working late into the night."
cdm|private sector,"_MECHANISMS: _ Delegates considered the project cycle of the <span class=""highlight"">CDM</span>. The G-77/CHINA stressed the need to address the <span class=""highlight"">CDM</span>Â’s driving force, nature and scope. AUSTRALIA said the <span class=""highlight"">CDM</span> should be largely <span class=""highlight"">private sector</span> driven. He added that investors needed to know that credits will be forthcoming."
cdm|baselines|emission|forest|sink,"SOUTH AFRICA, the SUDAN, BOLIVIA, MEXICO and MAURITANIA suggested that the <span class=""highlight"">CDM</span> include the concept of <span class=""highlight"">emissions</span> avoidance. BOLIVIA proposed including <span class=""highlight"">forest</span> protection initiatives under <span class=""highlight"">emissions</span> avoidance. MEXICO said he looked forward to using the <span class=""highlight"">CDM</span> to supplement national efforts to shift from slash- and-burn techniques, which are responsible for loss of <span class=""highlight"">forest</span> cover, to sustainable technologies that would have a positive <span class=""highlight"">impact on climate change</span>. MAURITANIA objected to the inclusion of <span class=""highlight"">forest</span> protection within the <span class=""highlight"">CDM</span>, as Parties would seek to protect their <span class=""highlight"">forests</span> regardless of its inclusion. IRAN said the <span class=""highlight"">CDM</span> should include projects related to both <span class=""highlight"">sinks</span> and sources. On the issue of <span class=""highlight"">baselines</span> for <span class=""highlight"">emissions</span> avoidance projects, NEW ZEALAND suggested that, to minimize transaction costs, the commercial contract-bidding process should be used to identify the <span class=""highlight"">baseline</span>. The EU said the <span class=""highlight"">baselines</span> should be determined on a project-by-project basis."
cdm|cdm projects|impact assessments,"SWITZERLAND said that in considering the types of projects that are eligible, possible negative <span class=""highlight"">spillover effects</span> into other multilateral domains should be taken into consideration. MOROCCO stressed the need to certify that reduced or avoided <span class=""highlight"">emissions</span> are real, measurable and contribute to sustainable <span class=""highlight"">development</span> in the host country. With SWITZERLAND, she said <span class=""highlight"">CDM</span> projects should be subjected to rigorous <span class=""highlight"">impact assessment</span> studies that take into account the socio-economic aspects of the host country."

MAURITANIA asked how transparency of and accountability for the <span class=""highlight"">investment</span> will be ensured."
cdm|additionality|cdm projects|funding|private sector,"On unilateral <span class=""highlight"">funding</span> of <span class=""highlight"">CDM</span> projects, JAPAN asked whether unilaterally-funded projects were consistent with the concept of <span class=""highlight"">CDM</span>. The REPUBLIC OF KOREA said unilateral <span class=""highlight"">funding</span> for <span class=""highlight"">CDM</span> would provide incentives for non-Annex I Parties to implement measures to reduce GHGs. COLOMBIA highlighted the potential of indigenous <span class=""highlight"">private sector</span> projects. He said that as long as <span class=""highlight"">CDM</span> projects demonstrate <span class=""highlight"">additionality</span> and lead to real and measurable long-term reductions, there should be <span class=""highlight"">flexibility</span> in financing the projects. On unilateral <span class=""highlight"">CDM</span>, NEW ZEALAND noted that <span class=""highlight"">additionality</span> would require careful judgments."
cdm|additionality|gef|funding|private sector,"Regarding the use of <span class=""highlight"">ODA</span> and <span class=""highlight"">GEF</span> <span class=""highlight"">funds</span>, the EU said <span class=""highlight"">CDM</span> <span class=""highlight"">funding</span> should not compete with these sources but that we would be open to discussion of all options as long as conditions for validation and certification are met. The G-77/CHINA emphasized that <span class=""highlight"">CDM</span> <span class=""highlight"">funding</span> should be over and above <span class=""highlight"">ODA</span>, <span class=""highlight"">GEF</span> and other financial commitments. JAPAN said there were no provisions requiring financial <span class=""highlight"">additionality</span> and none that preclude the use of <span class=""highlight"">ODA</span> as a source of <span class=""highlight"">funding</span>. He said the <span class=""highlight"">CDM</span> should be mainly funded by the <span class=""highlight"">private sector</span>. The G-77/CHINA said <span class=""highlight"">funding</span> <span class=""highlight"">additionality</span> flows from the fact that the purpose of the <span class=""highlight"">CDM</span> is to assist Annex I Parties in attaining their commitments"
funding,"A draft decision being prepared by developing countries has stirred some concern in the corridors. The draft proposal would limit the decision on capacity building to climate change considerations. Supporters of an all- encompassing approach to capacity building argue that their approach would be <span class=""highlight"">cost effective</span> and more consistent with the associated benefits of sustainable <span class=""highlight"">development</span>. However, those in support of focusing capacity building on climate change stress that it must follow the mandate of the FCCC if the limited pot of <span class=""highlight"">funding</span> is to be used effectively and produce tangible results. They say decisions on comprehensive capacity building must await a maturing of linkages across Convention institutions."

Despite some lingering <span class=""highlight"">uncertainties</span>, a majority of scientists believe that precautionary and prompt action is necessary."
greenhouse gas emissions|gas|emission,"The international response to climate change took shape with the <span class=""highlight"">development</span> of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). Agreed to in 1992, the UNFCCC sets out a framework for action to control <span class=""highlight"">greenhouse gas emissions. Its aim is to stabilize atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases at a level that would prevent anthropogenic (human-induced) actions from leading to dangerous interference with the climate system. The UNFCCC entered into force on 21 March 1994, 90 days after the receipt of the 50th ratification. It has now received 184 instruments of ratification, acceptance, approval or accession. Since it entered into force, five meetings of the Conference of the Parties (COP) have taken place, as well as numerous workshops and meetings of the UNFCCC's subsidiary bodies - the Subsidiary Body for Implementation (SBI) and the Subsidiary Body for Scientific and Technological Advice (SBSTA).</span>"

Following intense negotiations, delegates to COP-3, which was held in Kyoto, Japan in December 1997, agreed to a Protocol to the UNFCCC that commits developed countries and countries making the transition to a market economy to achieve quantified targets for decreasing their <span class=""highlight"">emissions</span> of greenhouse <span class=""highlight"">gases</span>. These countries, known under the UNFCCC as Annex I Parties, committed themselves to reducing their overall <span class=""highlight"">emissions</span> of six greenhouse <span class=""highlight"">gases</span> by at least 5% below <span class=""highlight"">1990 levels</span> over the period between 2008 and 2012, with differentiated targets for most of these countries.

cdm|baselines|emission|reforestation|sink,"Mechanisms:   While negotiators in Kyoto agreed that the mechanisms developed under the Protocol could help developed countries lower the costs of meeting their national <span class=""highlight"">emissions</span> targets, countries differ on the operational details governing the use of the mechanisms Ã¯Â¿Â½ details that must be set at COP-6. Key decisions include the <span class=""highlight"">accounting rules</span> for allocating credits, as well as the roles and responsibilities of various institutions. For the <span class=""highlight"">CDM</span> and <span class=""highlight"">JI</span>, countries must decide which projects are eligible and what the <span class=""highlight"">baselines</span> are for measuring the <span class=""highlight"">emissions</span>-reduction contribution of any specific project. A particularly controversial issue is whether to allow only projects that reduce <span class=""highlight"">emissions</span>, or whether to include projects that remove existing or future carbon from the atmosphere Ã¯Â¿Â½ <span class=""highlight"">carbon sinks projects such as reforestation. Although differing on the specific conditions, countries in favor of including sinks within the CDM include the US, Canada, Australia, Japan and Norway. Inclusion is also favored by the Environmental Integrity Group (a recently formed negotiating group comprising Switzerland, Mexico and the Republic of Korea), and some developing countries, such as Peru, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Bolivia and Uruguay. On the other side, the EU, as well as developing countries such as Tuvalu, Samoa, China and Jamaica, want sinks to be excluded from the CDM.</span>"
reducing emissions|emission,"Another contentious issue is whether there should be a limit or ceiling on how much of a countryÃ¯Â¿Â½s <span class=""highlight"">emissions</span> reduction target can be met through the mechanisms. According to the Protocol, use of the mechanisms should be supplemental to domestic <span class=""highlight"">policies and measures</span>. The EU, with support from some developing countries, has taken the position that a definite ceiling should be imposed on using the mechanisms, so that they contribute to reaching no more than 50% of a countryÃ¯Â¿Â½s <span class=""highlight"">emissions</span> reduction target. The introduction of a ceiling is opposed by countries belonging to the Umbrella Group Ã¯Â¿Â½ a loose alliance of Annex 1 Parties that includes the US, Canada, Australia, Japan, Norway, the Russian Federation and Ukraine Ã¯Â¿Â½ as well as by some developing countries."

This would reduce the pressure for domestic action.</span>"
cdm,"Other key issues requiring a decision by delegates include whether a share of proceeds should be established under <span class=""highlight"">JI</span> and <span class=""highlight"">emissions</span> trading, and how closely procedures for <span class=""highlight"">JI</span> should mirror those for <span class=""highlight"">CDM</span> activities."
baselines|forest|lulucf|sink,"<span class=""highlight"">Carbon Sinks:   The use of carbon sinks in meeting emissions targets Ã¯Â¿Â½ which has been considered within discussions on LULUCF - is both complex and controversial. Plants and soils can act as carbon sinks, but the science of estimating how much carbon is being removed from the atmosphere is uncertain. Including the use of sinks in meeting targets on emissions will require a clear definition of a sink, as well as clarity on what changes are the result of deliberate climate policies. Parties must also agree on accounting systems that set the baselines and measure carbon changes. Issues of the permanence of carbon storage achieved through forests and other sinks must also be addressed, given that such carbon can be lost due to felling, forest fires and other factors.</span>"
additional activities|reforestation,"According to a non-paper published by COP-6 President-designate Jan Pronk on 2 November, delegates will need to determine how <span class=""highlight"">reforestation</span> will be defined, including whether to include regeneration after the harvest cycle, what activities should be considered under Protocol Article 3.4 (<span class=""highlight"">additional activities</span>), whether such activities should be considered in the first commitment period, and whether the natural uptake of carbon should be separated from direct human-induced effects."
compliance system|enforcement,"Compliance:   A key element of the <span class=""highlight"">Kyoto Protocol</span> is a <span class=""highlight"">compliance system</span> that can determine whether countries have met their commitments under the Protocol, as well as deciding what should happen in cases of non-compliance. Delegates generally agree that the system should provide for both facilitation and <span class=""highlight"">enforcement</span> approaches to dealing with compliance issues, with the latter only applying to Annex I Parties. The G-77/China advocates that the principle of common but <span class=""highlight"">differentiated responsibilities</span> should govern the system and that, consequently, specific facilitation consequences should apply to developing countries. Some developed countries stress that it is the nature of the commitment that should direct an issue to facilitation or <span class=""highlight"">enforcement</span> consequences. On the composition of the body dealing with <span class=""highlight"">enforcement</span>, the G-77/China urges the application of equitable geographical representation while developed countries favor a stronger representation of Annex I Parties. Delegates also disagree on, _inter alia, _the nature of the applicable consequences, with the EU and <span class=""highlight"">small island</span> developing Parties being the most strident in favor of strong penalties, and the relationship between the <span class=""highlight"">compliance body</span> and the Conference of the Parties serving as the meeting of the Parties."

Noting that the last two decades have been the warmest in 1000 years, he said the question is no longer whether the climate is changing in response to human activities, but rather how much, how fast, and where. He noted a projected increase in global mean surface temperatures of about 1.5oC - 6oC by 2100 (almost double the previous <span class=""highlight"">IPCC</span> predictions), an increase in sea levels, and increases in the frequency and magnitude of the El Nino effect, and outlined the negative implications of these increases for <span class=""highlight"">water</span> resources, <span class=""highlight"">agriculture</span>, natural <span class=""highlight"">ecosystems</span> and human <span class=""highlight"">health</span>. He highlighted anticipated decreases in <span class=""highlight"">precipitation</span> in existing arid areas and underlined the likely increase in insect-borne vector diseases.

On the mandate of the <span class=""highlight"">enforcement</span> branch, the G-77/CHINA stated the branch should only deal with Annex I Parties. The EU, JAPAN and the US said the references to Annex I Party could be deleted since the articles falling into the scope of that branch only applied to Annex I Parties and since non-Annex I Parties were not submitted to host-country requirements under the <span class=""highlight"">CDM</span>. SAUDI ARABIA and the UNITED ARAB EMIRATES, opposed by SAMOA and JAPAN, said Article 3.14 (<span class=""highlight"">adverse effects</span>) was enforceable.

He said smaller informal groups would be invited to consult on specific issues, as little time remained, and assured delegates that the process would remain transparent. He said the main points to be resolved included definitions, accounting and reporting rules, and limitation of credits. Distinguishing between <span class=""highlight"">bottom-up</span> limitations of eligible activities and <span class=""highlight"">top-down </span>limitations of credits, he invited Parties to provide comments on the section of the new text relating to limitation of credits (additions and subtractions from PartiesÂ’ assigned amounts), noting limitation of credits could apply overall or in the form of a cap, threshold or discounting. The US and CANADA presented a proposal for the phase-in of <span class=""highlight"">forest</span> management under Article 3.4 (<span class=""highlight"">additional activities</span>), stressing that it contained incentives to implement additional sequestration activities. Under this approach, a certain amount of carbon would be credited, after which a discount would be applied. After a second threshold, full crediting would again be permitted."

INDONESIA said <span class=""highlight"">accounting rules</span> for Annex I countries should be applicable also within the <span class=""highlight"">CDM</span> and called for incorporation of social and cultural dimensions. TUVALU, on behalf of AOSIS, questioned the status of the new text, noting that some submissions had not been incorporated. COLOMBIA and BOLIVIA cautioned against a pick-and-choose approach under Article 3.4, under which Annex I Parties could account for <span class=""highlight"">additional activities</span> that sequester carbon but ignore additional sources."
lulucf,"PERU, BRAZIL and PAPUA NEW GUINEA stressed the need to preserve the integrity of the Protocol and the importance of <span class=""highlight"">emissions</span> reductions in Annex I countries. The US, opposed by CHINA, AOSIS and PERU, supported a decision on Article 3.3 and 3.4 as a package at COP-6, arguing that this is critical for the success of the Protocol.

CHINA and GHANA underscored a <span class=""highlight"">sectoral approach</span> to <span class=""highlight"">technology</span> transfer. On POLANDÂ´s suggestion to reflect the priorities of <span class=""highlight"">economies in transition</span> in the text, BRAZIL said this was not explicitly reflected in UNFCCC Article 4.5, which refers to developing countries in particular."

TRINIDAD &amp; TOBAGO preferred a broader reference to environmentally-sound <span class=""highlight"">technology</span> rather than specifying <span class=""highlight"">mitigation and adaptation</span> technologies. On the use of experts, the EU said it would be difficult to charge experts with defining country-driven approaches. The US said the experts should work on guidelines for developing such approaches."

THAILAND and CHINA objected, noting that Article 4.5 specifically refers to Annex II Parties and not other institutions. NIGERIA said <span class=""highlight"">technology</span> needs assessment should not depend on the availability of <span class=""highlight"">funds</span>."

The US and EU requested that text on the provision of financial and technical support for the implementation of the framework through the <span class=""highlight"">GEF</span> within its mandate be bracketed. Co-Chair Uosukainen said he would consult on a proposal by the EU to include Protocol Article 10 (existing commitments) in the preamble of the draft decision.

The most obvious example has been the question of <span class=""highlight"">sinks</span> within the <span class=""highlight"">CDM</span>, with the contact groups on the mechanisms and <span class=""highlight"">LULUCF</span> trying to coordinate their respective work, an effort some suggest has been exploited by particular groups to slow talks and shift responsibility."

The EU, the ENVIRONMENTAL INTEGRITY GROUP, NORWAY and CHILE agreed, but said the approach is not yet mature and the definition in the Co-ChairsÂ’ text will suffice for the time being. They said guidance on the <span class=""highlight"">biome</span> approach should be sought from the <span class=""highlight"">IPCC</span>. The EU stressed the need for consistency and symmetry within all definitions, while CHINA said it would be premature to agree on definitions relevant to Protocol Article 3.4 (<span class=""highlight"">additional activities</span>)."
afforestation|reforestation,"The EU, with NEW ZEALAND and opposed by CHINA, MALAYSIA and BHUTAN, supported including the promotion of natural regeneration within the definitions of <span class=""highlight"">afforestation</span> and <span class=""highlight"">reforestation</span>. BRAZIL and PERU said natural regeneration is a management approach according to the <span class=""highlight"">IPCC</span> Special Report, and is not always human-induced."

forest,"On the issue of Eligibility, TUVALU and PERU said activities under Article 3.3 subsequent to 1990 should not be eligible. Delegates then discussed two eligibility requirement options: a list of international agreements or a list of ancillary environmental effects to be taken into account. NEW ZEALAND, with CANADA and AUSTRALIA, proposed including text on the relationship between implementation of activities and other international agreements in the preamble. TUVALU proposed a new principle referring to the non-eligibility under Article 3.4 of activities that convert native <span class=""highlight"">forests</span>."

TUVALU and the ENVIRONMENTAL INTEGRITY GROUP requested deletion of text that would allow Parties to elect the activities under Article 3.4 to be included in the first commitment period. On <span class=""highlight"">additional activities</span> during the second and subsequent commitment periods, the EU, NORWAY, TUVALU and MALAYSIA, opposed by JAPAN, said the COP should establish a list prior to the <span class=""highlight"">second commitment period</span>. AUSTRALIA suggested introducing text ensuring definitional and accounting consistencies between <span class=""highlight"">first and subsequent </span>commitment periods. The ENVIRONMENTAL INTEGRITY GROUP supported a full carbon accounting system that would not require the listing of activities, while COLOMBIA expressed concern with an activity-based approach and proposed a symmetrical approach."

lulucf,"Regarding issuance and cancellation of assigned amounts (AA) related to Protocol Article 3.3 and 3.4, the G-77/CHINA, supported by the EU and US, suggested referring to additions and subtractions from AA in the guidelines under Article 7. Opposed by NEW ZEALAND and supported by INDIA, he added that, pending agreement of this issue in the <span class=""highlight"">LULUCF</span> group, any reference to Article 3.4 should be bracketed. Co-Chair Newton Paciornik (Brazil) said the Co-Chairs would consult on this issue with the Co-Chairs of the contact group on <span class=""highlight"">LULUCF</span>. In the guidelines under Article 8, the G-77/CHINA suggested deleting Part III on the review of information on AA. INDIA explained that AA are fixed amounts and therefore cannot be reviewed, however the information on additions and subtractions would be reviewed. BRAZIL, on behalf of the G-77/CHINA, then introduced a text for a new Part III _bis_ that addresses the terminology initial AA and replaces it with amounts that contribute to the compliance of a Party included in Annex I with the quantified <span class=""highlight"">emission</span> limitation and <span class=""highlight"">reduction commitment</span> under Article 3."
expert review,"On <span class=""highlight"">expert review</span> teams (ERTs), the G-77/CHINA recommended drawing on a roster of experts and reflecting regional balance. He said teams should be supported by the Secretariat and not by governments, in order to ensure their impartiality."
expert review,"On confidentiality, the EU introduced new text that provides, _inter alia_, that the ERTs shall guarantee the confidentiality of information that a Party indicates is confidential, and that if a Party does not provide sufficient information for the assessment of its conformity with the revised <span class=""highlight"">IPCC</span> guidelines, the <span class=""highlight"">ERT</span> shall assume the estimate was not prepared accordingly. Commenting on this proposal, SAMOA suggested that the Party be required to provide the basis for confidentiality protection under domestic legislation and that potential conflicts of interest with an <span class=""highlight"">ERT</span> member be dealt with before the team is formed."

The EU reported that no major differences remained in the group that had worked on the first three themes - <span class=""highlight"">technology</span> needs assessment, <span class=""highlight"">technology</span> information, and enabling environments. Speaking for the second drafting group, GHANA said only the section on capacity building had been considered. He said divergence remained on the inclusion of <span class=""highlight"">CDM</span> and <span class=""highlight"">JI</span> in the framework. He also noted the discussion on and differences in the use of the terms are encouraged to or shall when describing actions in the framework."
eit|economies in transition|technology|technology transfer,"Delegates then began considering the revised text from the first drafting group. On the paragraph defining <span class=""highlight"">technology</span> needs and needs assessment, delegates debated whether to retain reference to Parties not included in Annex II, particularly developing country Parties as a way of addressing the proposal to also include countries with <span class=""highlight"">economies in transition</span> (EITs). The G-77/CHINA and BRAZIL urged consistency with UNFCCC language and preferred inserting other countries, particularly developing countries. The G-77/CHINA said the paragraph only refers to developing country responsibilities and not how the needs assessment will contribute to fulfilling commitments on <span class=""highlight"">technology</span> transfer. Discussion on this issue was deferred to further consultations."
technology|technology transfer,"Regarding the purpose of <span class=""highlight"">technology</span> needs and needs assessment, the PHILIPPINES sought clarification on how these would contribute to the implementation of Article 4.5. She opposed a US proposal to state that <span class=""highlight"">technology</span> needs assessments can attract and focus efforts by Annex II Parties to enhance <span class=""highlight"">development</span> and transfer of <span class=""highlight"">technology</span>. The REPUBLIC OF KOREA said the needs assessment should be used to facilitate efforts by Annex II Parties, while the G-77/CHINA preferred stating that they should facilitate transfer of and access to ESTs."
technology|private sector|technology transfer,"The REPUBLIC OF KOREA, with PERU, said too much emphasis was being placed on the needs assessment while losing focus on implementing <span class=""highlight"">technology</span> transfer. He said it would be difficult, if not impossible, for public sectors to provide all information that also covered the <span class=""highlight"">private sector</span>. He emphasized the need to build on existing activities and information. Cautioning against shifting responsibility to developing countries, NIGERIA stressed the need to refer to who will be responsible for the needs assessment._"
adverse effects/impacts|financial resources|funding,"<span class=""highlight"">ADVERSE EFFECTS</span>:   Delegates continued to discuss the text in the draft decision, retaining brackets around a sub-paragraph on demonstration adaptation projects, and on immediate implementation of certain adaptation activities. On a sub-paragraph on <span class=""highlight"">disaster</span> preparedness and management, CANADA, supported by AUSTRALIA and the US, said <span class=""highlight"">disaster</span> prevention was impossible, and the terminology should reflect this. The G-77/CHINA, supported by MARSHALL ISLANDS and SAUDI ARABIA, said that <span class=""highlight"">disasters</span> were dependent on the impact of weather events on human beings, and could therefore be prevented. She supported retaining the term prevention. Discussion on the proposed <span class=""highlight"">disaster</span> <span class=""highlight"">fund</span> was postponed pending outcomes on financial discussions elsewhere. Several brackets remained in the discussed paragraph, pending decision on the wording of the chapeau, which identifies <span class=""highlight"">financial resources</span> for the activities outlined in this paragraph. Later in the evening, a small Friends of a Chair group met in a closed session to continue discussing the text. This group will meet on Thursday to resume consideration on the numerous outstanding issues, while the full contact group will resume on Friday."

Discussions focused on text relating to the provision of <span class=""highlight"">GEF</span> resources for country-driven Stage II adaptation activities, particularly the extent to which such activities are based on national communications. Consultations are set to continue on Thursday."
enforcement|facilitative branch,"On consequences of the <span class=""highlight"">enforcement</span> branch, NEW ZEALAND, opposed by BRAZIL and INDIA, suggested new text on the issuance of assigned amounts under Article 3.3 and 3.4. On the consequences of the <span class=""highlight"">facilitative branch</span>, the G-77/CHINA rejected an EU proposal that does not differentiate between Annex I and non- Annex I Parties. On appeal, delegates made preliminary comments on a Co- ChairsÃ¯Â¿Â½ proposal providing for the possibility of an appeal to the COP/MOP. The G-77/CHINA favored a narrow scope such as issues of due process and Article 3.1. A number of delegations said they needed more time to consider the proposal."

While talk in the corridors suggested that some developing countries seemed to be taking a more favorable view on including <span class=""highlight"">nuclear</span> <span class=""highlight"">energy</span>, some commentators pointed to recent comments by a key Annex I Party that suggested it might in fact be softening on its previously pro-<span class=""highlight"">nuclear</span> attitude."

The Joint <span class=""highlight"">Working Group on Compliance</span> (<span class=""highlight"">JWG</span>) also met to continue its work on negotiating text. In addition, negotiators met throughout the day and late into the night in closed informal informal consultations and drafting groups to advance negotiations on issues such as mechanisms, compliance, <span class=""highlight"">development</span> and <span class=""highlight"">transfer of technologies</span>, the <span class=""highlight"">financial mechanism</span>, <span class=""highlight"">adverse effects</span> and capacity building in developing countries."
cdm|compliance system|enforcement,"Delegates met in a formal meeting and heard a presentation by the G-77/CHINA on its views, contained in a new submission, on consequences under a <span class=""highlight"">compliance regime</span>. On facilitative consequences, the G-77/CHINA reiterated that these should be differentiated between Annex I and non-Annex I Parties. On <span class=""highlight"">enforcement</span> consequences, she said these should only apply to Annex I Parties. She then presented the proposed consequences, to be decided by the <span class=""highlight"">enforcement</span> branch, in case of non-compliance with several provisions of the Protocol. In the case of non-compliance with Articles 5 and 7, the PartyÂ’s eligibility to participate in the mechanisms would be suspended and it would be required to submit a plan including measures to remedy the non-compliance. One or more other measures, such as declaration of non-compliance and suspension of rights and privileges, would be decided. If a Party does not meet the eligibility requirements under Articles 6 (<span class=""highlight"">JI</span>), 12 (<span class=""highlight"">CDM</span>) and 17 (<span class=""highlight"">emissions</span> trading), its eligibility to participate in the mechanisms would be suspended. If the Party concerned is an Article 4 (joint fulfillment) Party, the eligibility of the other Parties operating under that provision would be suspended as well."
adverse effects/impacts|funding|compliance system,"In case of non-compliance with Article 3.1 (assigned amounts - AA), the G-77/CHINA said the strictest of measures should be applied. She called for the combination of three consequences for the non-compliant Party in order to ensure effectiveness and avoid loopholes: a contribution to the <span class=""highlight"">Compliance Fund, to be established; the deduction from its AA in the subsequent commitment period with a penalty rate; and a submission of a Compliance Action Plan. Additional consequences could also be set. In the case of non-compliance with Article 3.14 (adverse effects), the Party concerned would be required to commit itself to an Article 3.14 Plan indicating the measures intended to be implemented in order to resolve the issue in question, and it could be subjected to the suspension of rights and privileges.</span>"
funding|compliance system,"SAUDI ARABIA, on behalf of the ARABIAN COUNTRIES GROUP, said non-compliance with Article 3.14 should also lead to suspension of eligibility to participate in the mechanisms and a financial penalty paid to a <span class=""highlight"">compensation</span> <span class=""highlight"">fund</span>. NEW ZEALAND questioned the aspects of establishing an action plan as well as a compliance <span class=""highlight"">fund</span>, since these would remove the stringency of the consequences by extending the period of non-compliance and adding complexity."
eit|economies in transition,"CAPACITY BUILDING: <span class=""highlight"">Economies in Transition</span> (EITs):   Delegates met briefly in a contact group to consider the remaining brackets in the draft decision on capacity building in EITs. They removed brackets around reference to Protocol Article 10 (existing commitments) in the preamble, noting that this Article refers to all Parties. However, they retained brackets around paragraphs addressing <span class=""highlight"">financial support</span> for the implementation of the framework, pending the outcome of discussions in the group on the <span class=""highlight"">financial mechanism</span>. The contact group agreed to forward the text with the remaining brackets to the subsidiary bodies."
gef|financial mechanism,"Developing countries:   Delegates met in informal informal consultations throughout the day to work on bracketed paragraphs in the draft decision and proposed framework text. They agreed to defer the paragraphs on financing and the role of the <span class=""highlight"">GEF</span> to the contact group addressing the <span class=""highlight"">financial mechanism</span>. They removed brackets on a number of paragraphs in the draft decision. However, differences remained over who would monitor and review progress of implementation of the decision, and at what intervals. Informal informal consultations continued late into the night."

Revised text was circulated on: the role of the COP/MOP, the Executive Board, the accreditation body, designated <span class=""highlight"">operational entities</span>, participation, financing, monitoring, verification, certification, issuance of <span class=""highlight"">CERs</span>, standards and procedures for the accreditation of <span class=""highlight"">operational entities</span>, a <span class=""highlight"">CDM</span> reference manual, and a project design document. Emphasizing that negotiations need to be completed by midnight on Friday, 17 November, he urged the group to show leadership in completing their discussions in a timely manner."

Rather than singling out developing country Parties or countries with <span class=""highlight"">economies in transition</span>, the contact group decided to make reference to Parties other than developed country Parties and other developed Parties not included in Annex II, particularly developing country Parties. The three sections were then agreed upon."
technology|technology transfer mechanism|technology transfer,"The contact group then reconvened in a closed evening session and focused on the remaining sections on capacity building and mechanisms for <span class=""highlight"">technology</span> transfer. Delegates debated whether language used in the framework should be obligatory, that is, whether to use shall or are encouraged to. The group then considered the mechanisms for <span class=""highlight"">technology</span> transfer. There was divergence over the need for, and composition and functions of, the proposed intergovernmental panel of experts or advisory group of experts. The group continued its work late into the night.

On the decision that future work should take place through initiatives involving all Parties and should include the exchange of information on <span class=""highlight"">P&amp;Ms</span>, SAUDI ARABIA, opposed by CANADA, emphasized that the information should relate to the <span class=""highlight"">P&amp;Ms</span> of Annex I Parties. Other text that was bracketed included: SAUDIA ARABIAÂ’s proposed reference to methodological issues related to assessing the effectiveness and impact of <span class=""highlight"">P&amp;Ms</span>; a reference proposed by the US to assessing/ characterizing the effectiveness of <span class=""highlight"">P&amp;Ms</span>; and the EUÂ’s reference to the future structured work on <span class=""highlight"">P&amp;Ms</span>."

NEW ZEALAND, with the EU, US and JAPAN, emphasized that such estimates from all sectors should be prepared under good practice guidance, and be adjusted when they are not prepared according to the agreed methodologies. In elements for a draft COP/MOP-1 decision on this matter, the EU, SWITZERLAND and NORWAY disagreed over a US proposal, supported by SAUDI ARABIA, NEW ZEALAND and AUSTRALIA, to include text on ensuring that adjustment procedures are conservative so that Parties would not be unduly penalised. The Co-Chairs requested interested Parties to meet to further discuss the unresolved paragraphs."

Noting that permanence is the main problem related to <span class=""highlight"">LULUCF</span> activities, he suggested all <span class=""highlight"">LULUCF</span> projects be treated as potentially non- permanent, and said that associated <span class=""highlight"">CERs</span> should expire after a specific time period, after which they would be replaced by permanent <span class=""highlight"">CERs</span> or new expiring <span class=""highlight"">CERs</span>.

He cautioned against perverse incentives to cut <span class=""highlight"">forests</span>, and said that for many countries <span class=""highlight"">forest</span> conservation would be the main way to participate in efforts to stabilize the global climate."
cdm|leakage|lulucf|sink,"Expressing concern with the interventions of delegates, Co-Chairs Thorgeirsson and Gwage appealed to delegates to focus on technical aspects with a view to providing advice to the contact group on mechanisms. The G-77/CHINA urged no prejudgement on the issue of <span class=""highlight"">sinks</span> in the <span class=""highlight"">CDM</span>. He drew attention to the GroupÃ¯Â¿Â½s principle on permanence, underlining that <span class=""highlight"">sinks</span> provide temporary removal only. The EU expressed surprise at the Co-ChairÃ¯Â¿Â½s request to provide solutions, saying that he was not convinced that solutions exist. He argued that inclusion of <span class=""highlight"">sinks</span> would reduce the transfer of <span class=""highlight"">emission</span> reduction <span class=""highlight"">technology</span> to developing countries. COSTA RICA argued that global <span class=""highlight"">leakage</span> would be a significant problem should <span class=""highlight"">LULUCF</span> activities not be allowed under the <span class=""highlight"">CDM</span>, as timber stocks in different parts of the world are linked through the global market, and a small shift of logging activities from Annex I countries to non-Annex I countries would lead to a proportionally larger increase in loss of carbon."

With JAPAN, she questioned why the issue of scale is specifically raised in the context of <span class=""highlight"">LULUCF</span> projects, arguing that the institutional <span class=""highlight"">infrastructure</span> will ensure that <span class=""highlight"">LULUCF</span> projects are additional, measurable and verifiable. COLOMBIA emphasized that the aim of its proposal is not to transfer <span class=""highlight"">Annex I commitments</span>. He underlined the value of procedures being proposed in the mechanisms group to ensure stakeholder participation within <span class=""highlight"">forestry</span> projects."

Delegates agreed to this report. The G-77/CHINA expressed satisfaction with the outcome of the <span class=""highlight"">JWG</span>Â’s work and said she would submit text on a fourth option for the draft COP-6 decision. The EU said it had submitted text to the Secretariat on the rates applicable for the restoration of <span class=""highlight"">emissions</span> under the compliance action plan and for payments to be made to the <span class=""highlight"">compliance fund. Co-Chair Dovland said the inputs received would be integrated into a new document available Saturday, 18 November, for consideration by the joint meeting of SBI/SBSTA. He concluded the final meeting of the JWG by underlining that although delegates had hoped to have a clear text as the JWGÂ’s end product, this had been challenging due to the large number of difficult issues that had to be addressed.

CANADA argued that this issue is being examined in the contact group on Articles 5, 7 and 8. With the support of JAPAN, AUSTRALIA and the US, and opposed by the G-77/CHINA and the EU, he proposed replacing the decision and its associated initiatives with alternative text stating that consideration of <span class=""highlight"">demonstrable progress</span> cannot take place until the SBSTA has considered the issue pursuant to the guidelines that may be elaborated under Article 7. Although opposing retention of the listed initiatives, JAPAN, the US and AUSTRALIA, opposed by the G-77/CHINA, also provided amendments to the existing text in case it should be retained, including: replacing text on the assessment of <span class=""highlight"">demonstrable progress</span> by 2005 with a request to Parties to continue sharing information; replacing the requirement to assess and minimize the <span class=""highlight"">adverse effects</span> of <span class=""highlight"">P&amp;Ms</span> with a requirement to facilitate information sharing on this issue; and bracketing reference to the use of quantitative criteria in reporting on <span class=""highlight"">P&amp;Ms</span> in national communications."

base year,"PROTOCOL ARTICLES 5, 7 &amp; 8:   Delegates in this contact group convened to continue consideration of the Co-ChairsÂ’ working paper containing draft decisions under Articles 5, 7 and 8 as well as draft guidelines under Articles 7 and 8. On the draft COP/ MOP-1 decision related to Article 5.2 (adjustments), the US suggested that adjustments applying to a PartyÂ’s base- year inventory estimates could not be replaced by revised estimates subsequent to the establishment of a PartyÂ’s initial assigned amounts. The G-77/CHINA, opposed by the EU, said inventory estimates of a year during the commitment period that had been adjusted should not be revised and that consequently, adjustments of estimates of both the <span class=""highlight"">base year</span> inventory and the inventory during the commitment period could not be revised."

He said the proposal involves the subtraction of a <span class=""highlight"">biome</span>-specific threshold value for windfall effects as well as a threshold value to account for other <span class=""highlight"">uncertainties</span> from any measured and verified <span class=""highlight"">sink</span> credits, and applies to all <span class=""highlight"">sinks</span> under all relevant Protocol Articles in all commitment periods."

He introduced the structure and content of the text, noting changes to, _inter alia,_ the proposed definition of <span class=""highlight"">forest</span>, and the preambular Principles to the operative text. He said these had been replaced by two paragraphs affirming consistency with environmental and social principles, as little time remained for negotiating the preambular material."
biome|forest|definition of forest,"BRAZIL, for the G-77/CHINA, said he could not accept the deletion of the preambular Principles, and CHINA commented that too many options had been eliminated from the text. The US, EU, TUVALU, and PERU supported retention of the Principles. TUVALU, for AOSIS, expressed concern that the groupÂ’s suggestions, in particular one regarding the <span class=""highlight"">biome</span> approach to the definition of <span class=""highlight"">forest</span>, had not been considered, and that the text as it stands was unbalanced."

technology|private sector|technology transfer mechanism|technology transfer,"Delegates then adjourned into informal informal consultations where they discussed the Co-ChairsÂ’ proposals for a draft decision. They bracketed additional text in the preambular section, which includes language taken from the G-77/China submission and from submissions by other Parties. Divergence remains on references to the <span class=""highlight"">private sector</span>, the role of government and institutional arrangements. Consultations continued late into the night. It was proposed that on completing consideration of the draft decision, delegates will continue working on the section on mechanisms for <span class=""highlight"">technology</span> transfer in the draft framework text."
funding,"FINANCIAL ISSUES:   Co-Chair Kerry Groves (Australia) welcomed delegates to the first meeting of this group, which he said was mandated by COP-6 President Pronk. He explained that the group had been established in the light of the various <span class=""highlight"">funding</span> proposals being discussed in contact groups, and said this group would provide input that would assist President Pronk in preparing elements of a framework to integrate the various proposals. He said the Co- Chairs of this group would report to President Pronk on these consultations at 1:00 pm on Saturday, 18 November. President Pronk would use this to help focus deliberations among ministers and heads of delegation, scheduled to begin on Sunday, 19 November."

He invited Parties to examine the paper in order to identify what <span class=""highlight"">funding</span> activities participants thought might be undertaken by the <span class=""highlight"">GEF</span> as an <span class=""highlight"">operating entity</span> of the <span class=""highlight"">financial mechanism</span> of the UNFCCC, by the <span class=""highlight"">GEF</span> as a motivator of <span class=""highlight"">funds</span> outside its <span class=""highlight"">financial mechanism</span> role, and by alternative <span class=""highlight"">funding</span> sources/mechanisms."
gef|ldcs|funding,"Regarding text on a framework for capacity building for developing countries that refers to a special <span class=""highlight"">fund</span> to support implementation of this framework by the <span class=""highlight"">LDCs</span>, the US said he believed that many elements of this framework are relevant for <span class=""highlight"">GEF</span> <span class=""highlight"">funding</span>, although some may not be. On draft text stating that Annex II Parties should provide financial and technical resources for country- level needs assessments and for the <span class=""highlight"">development</span> of specific capacity building activities consistent with the capacity building framework, the EU indicated that at this stage it did not see the need for a new <span class=""highlight"">fund</span> outside of the <span class=""highlight"">GEF</span>."

They also did not agree on reference to developing <span class=""highlight"">national adaptation programmes of action</span>, with the US stating that this was under consideration in the contact group on <span class=""highlight"">adverse effects</span>. On financing and operation, divergence remained over whether financial and technical resources should be made available through an <span class=""highlight"">operating entity</span> of the <span class=""highlight"">financial mechanism</span> and as appropriate, multilateral and bilateral agencies."

The group discussed the revised Co-ChairsÃ¯Â¿Â½ text providing additional guidance to the <span class=""highlight"">operating entity</span> of the <span class=""highlight"">financial mechanism</span>. He noted that extensive informal informal consultations had taken place during the past few days, and that most of the text had been agreed. He then invited delegates to consider the remaining bracketed paragraphs. Delegates discussed at length two options for text of a paragraph relating to the provision of <span class=""highlight"">GEF</span> resources for country-driven Stage II adaptation activities, particularly the extent to which such activities would be based on national communications. Parties could not agree whether such activities should be in the context of/build upon national communications and national studies, or national communications or national studies. The text remains in brackets."
funding|gef,"Mixed reactions over the new group on financial issues mandated by COP-6 President Pronk were expressed in the corridors Friday. Whereas some welcomed the initiative as a useful move to help focus attention on financial issues, several developing countries expressed concerns at the procedure and problems of timing, given the hectic schedule of informal meetings taking place. According to observers, an underlying cause of sensitivity over talks on <span class=""highlight"">funding</span> mechanisms lies in differing views over the <span class=""highlight"">GEF</span>, with some developing countries pushing for alternative mechanisms. They suggest this could be based partly on G-77/ China hopes that another mechanism would increase overall <span class=""highlight"">funding</span>, an idea apparently rejected by a number of developed country delegates. In spite of these differences, however, there seems to be general support for President PronkÃ¯Â¿Â½s desire to encourage negotiators to focus on <span class=""highlight"">funding</span> issues ahead of deliberations by ministers and heads of delegation starting Sunday."

Due to the limited time, Co-Chair Afolabi proposed that the sections in the framework on capacity building and mechanisms for <span class=""highlight"">technology</span> transfer be bracketed. On the Co- ChairsÂ’ proposal for a draft decision, delegates agreed to delete one paragraph in the preamble of the decision that recalls UNFCCC Article 4.5 (<span class=""highlight"">development</span> and <span class=""highlight"">transfer of technologies</span>) and removed the brackets from a paragraph recalling chapter 34 of Agenda 21 and relevant provisions of the Programme for the Further implementation of Agenda 21.

Co-Chairs Gwage and Thorgeirsson explained that the Friends of the Chairs group had met for 11 hours through Friday night, but had not reached consensus on enough issues to warrant drawing-up new text. Co-Chair Thorgeirsson distributed draft SBSTA conclusions that transmit the work of the first week to the second week. He said the text he had introduced on Friday, 17 November, had been annexed to it and that the unedited preambular Principles had been reinserted. A number of delegates highlighted the need for further progress."

Delegates debated whether information on which to base actions should derive from both national communications and other relevant information, or from just one of these two sources. They bracketed these two alternatives. Co-Chair KjellÃ©n noted that agreement on the placement of the operative paragraphs on implementation of Article 4.9 replacing a section in the draft decision(s) would be announced by the G-77/China. The G-77/CHINA said it would present a new version of the text on Monday. Delegates then agreed to forward the draft decision(s) for consideration by the joint SBI/SBSTA."

He said delegates had convened in formal and informal meetings over the previous week. He underlined the constructive efforts of delegations during the groupÃ¯Â¿Â½s work. He said two submissions from Parties had been inadvertently omitted: option 1 of Principles should be replaced by option 1 contained in document FCCC/SB/ 2000/11; and the sentence [The procedures and mechanisms on compliance shall operate without prejudice to any Multilteral Consultative Process as referred in Article 16.] should be added to the paragraph on Relationship with Article 16. Following a request by NEW ZEALAND to introduce an additional option in the final clauses, Co-Chair Slade said Parties will have an opportunity to comment on the document. The EU then requested the introduction of several brackets. The report, as amended by Co-Chair Slade, was forwarded to the COP."

Chair Dovland reported that one agreed draft decision was being forwarded by the SBSTA to the COP for adoption, in addition to eight SBSTA draft decisions and four joint draft decisions of the subsidiary bodies for further consideration by the COP. The decision put forward for adoption is on Protocol Article 5.1 (national systems). Chair Dovland also identified key outstanding issues on the other draft decisions. On activities <span class=""highlight"">implemented jointly</span>, he said the key issue was whether the <span class=""highlight"">pilot phase</span> should continue. Regarding national systems, he highlighted the need to make a decision on questions of <span class=""highlight"">demonstrable progress</span>, and on reporting and review of assigned amounts. In relation to <span class=""highlight"">land use</span>, <span class=""highlight"">land-use</span> change and <span class=""highlight"">forestry</span> (<span class=""highlight"">LULUCF</span>), he raised questions of how to ensure full reporting of <span class=""highlight"">emissions</span> from <span class=""highlight"">deforestation</span> and separate removals from <span class=""highlight"">sinks</span> by direct human- induced activities and natural effects. With regard to the mechanisms, he noted that agreement had been reached on a <span class=""highlight"">prompt start</span> for the <span class=""highlight"">CDM</span>, on the features of its institutional architecture, and on the need for regional balance.

He said the Netherlands would achieve half of its <span class=""highlight"">emissions</span> reduction target of 6% through domestic measures, and half through the mechanisms. On developing countries and <span class=""highlight"">development</span> cooperation, he said the Netherlands would commit 200 million Dutch Guilders for <span class=""highlight"">adaptation measures</span> and capacity building, which would be additional to previously agreed contributions. He concluded that a worldwide package deal was needed at COP-6, and that participants should not leave without an agreement on the provision of adequate and substantial assistance to developing country Parties. Other elements of the outcome should include the identification of new patterns of production and <span class=""highlight"">consumption</span> in industrialised countries, the creation of an international market for <span class=""highlight"">greenhouse gas emissions permits, and preferential treatment for Least Developed Countries (LDCs) in the financial mechanisms and the UNFCCC.</span>"

He said each country has a duty to build structures that cut its own emissions to a minimum on a sustainable basis. He emphasized that flexible mechanisms should not be seen as a means to escape domestic measures. In this regard, he voiced FranceÂ’s support for GEF funding to be increased. He called for a prudent approach to carbon sinks, and said the polluter pays principle should apply with regard to international air transportation emissions.

UNIDO said bypassing countries with low <span class=""highlight"">emissions</span> in the <span class=""highlight"">CDM</span> in favor of larger emitters would be a lost opportunity to address social <span class=""highlight"">equity</span> needs. He stressed capacity building to overcome existing barriers and take advantage of the <span class=""highlight"">CDM</span> and <span class=""highlight"">JI</span>. Noting proposals to exclude <span class=""highlight"">nuclear</span> power from the <span class=""highlight"">CDM</span>, the INTERNATIONAL ATOMIC <span class=""highlight"">ENERGY</span> AGENCY urged Parties to consider <span class=""highlight"">nuclear</span> <span class=""highlight"">energy</span> in the context of climate change, stating that the concerns about safety and possible proliferation of weapons are not based on climate concerns. The CLIMATE NETWORK AFRICA emphasized the importance of a concrete adaptation <span class=""highlight"">fund</span>."
business,"On partnerships, the INTERNATIONAL CONFEDERATION OF TRADE UNIONS urged governments to cooperate with <span class=""highlight"">business</span> and labor organizations in meeting the long-term goal of addressing climate change, while the INTERNATIONAL COUNCIL FOR LOCAL ENVIRONMENTAL INITIATIVES (ICLEI) stressed the importance of supporting <span class=""highlight"">local governments</span>."

The GLOBAL LEGISLATORS ORGANIZATION FOR A BALANCED ENVIRONMENT (GLOBE) said there was a need for additional research on <span class=""highlight"">sinks</span> to eliminate prevailing scientific <span class=""highlight"">uncertainties</span>, while the INTERNATIONAL CHAMBER OF COMMERCE (ICC) supported their inclusion. The INDIGENOUS PEOPLEÂ’S ORGANIZATION opposed attempts to include <span class=""highlight"">sinks</span> in the <span class=""highlight"">CDM</span>. The CONFEDERATION OF EUROPEAN <span class=""highlight"">FOREST</span> OWNERS said <span class=""highlight"">forest</span> products provide long-term carbon storage and that <span class=""highlight"">carbon stock</span> changes should be calculated according to the growth in the volume of the <span class=""highlight"">forests</span>, and not just changes in <span class=""highlight"">land use</span>."

He noted that countries had been seated in their negotiating groupings or alliances so as to allow better consultations among members. He distributed an informal note summarizing his personal perspective on the progress made last week and the crunch issues still to be resolved in order to strike a balanced deal on the <span class=""highlight"">Buenos Aires Plan of Action</span>. He said such a help-desk approach would assist countries in focusing on the crunch issues requiring political negotiations and decisions. These crunch issues relate to capacity building, <span class=""highlight"">technology</span> transfer, <span class=""highlight"">adverse effects</span>, guidance to the <span class=""highlight"">GEF</span>, the mechanisms, <span class=""highlight"">LULUCF</span>, <span class=""highlight"">P&amp;Ms</span>, compliance, Protocol Articles 5,7 and 8, and the cross-cutting issues of <span class=""highlight"">funding</span> and <span class=""highlight"">funding</span> mechanisms. He then invited Parties to make short political statements on the basis of which he will make a proposal so as to help political leaders in their work."

He highlighted the need for full participation by all members of the Group so as to ensure transparency and openness, and opposed any fragmentation. He then listed the G-77/China coordinators for each of the outstanding issues."
agriculture|sink|forest,"Noting that the Protocol explicitly recognizes the role of <span class=""highlight"">forests</span> as potential sources and <span class=""highlight"">sinks</span> of carbon, the US argued that there is a growing consensus for the full inclusion of <span class=""highlight"">agricultural</span> and grazing land, and broad recognition of the central role of <span class=""highlight"">forests</span>, although less agreement on how to account for <span class=""highlight"">forests</span> within the Protocol. He outlined a proposal on behalf of the US, JAPAN and CANADA to account for the contribution of <span class=""highlight"">forests</span> in Annex I Parties. According to this proposal, all countries would be able to count fully not more than 20 million metric tonnes of annual <span class=""highlight"">carbon sequestration</span> in managed <span class=""highlight"">forests</span>. Noting concerns relating to scale, he proposed that currently projected sequestration beyond this level should be discounted by two-thirds. He argued that this approach, accompanied by full accounting for sequestration in <span class=""highlight"">farm</span> land, preserves the nature of the Kyoto bargain and is a key element for success at The Hague."
private sector,"Reacting to the US proposal, AOSIS said his group has a clear position on this subject, and that he looked forward to sharing it once the details of the US proposal were further clarified. BULGARIA, on behalf of the CENTRAL GROUP 11, said the Group would undertake to identify spokespersons for the individual issues by Tuesday, and would comment on President PronkÃ¯Â¿Â½s informal note once members had studied the document. Noting the importance of environmental integrity, JAPAN highlighted the need for rules to operationalize the Protocol and mobilize the <span class=""highlight"">private sector</span>. SAUDI ARABIA said Annex I Parties should present their financial commitments during the high-level meeting on Tuesday morning."
lulucf|additional activities,"The corridors were buzzing Monday evening as delegates pondered over the outcome of the afternoonÃ¯Â¿Â½s informal high-level meeting, and speculated on the next steps that President Pronk will be suggesting Tuesday morning. The US move to add hard numbers to its proposal on <span class=""highlight"">LULUCF</span> was seen by some as a pre- emptive compromise and a set back to the hard line position of countries that oppose <span class=""highlight"">additional activities</span>. Others, though, characterized the proposal as a fudge, arguing that the proposed full credit for 20 million metric tonnes of carbon is more than generous."

SAMOA and MICRONESIA argued that countries should be prohibited from offsetting their obligations through activities that are neither measurable nor permanent. JAPAN said it was essential not to lose the incentives for appropriate <span class=""highlight"">sink</span> activities. BOLIVIA said reduction credits resulting from natural variability should be avoided and that carbon accounting systems should be able to distinguish between human efforts and natural reductions. NORWAY said that contribution from <span class=""highlight"">sinks</span> should be limited in the first commitment period.

The US reiterated its position on the need to include sinks during the first commitment period and said its proposal provided flexibility and was based on a long-term perspective. He illustrated the potential scale of Article 3.4 activities, and said Parties have the ability to make accurate estimates. The ENVIRONMENTAL INTEGRITY GROUP said it was somewhat reassured by the statement of US regarding their proposal, and stressed the need for verifiability and additionality. The G-77/ CHINA stressed its principles on LULUCF and the need to exclude credits for natural uptake. The US, with JAPAN, said natural effects cannot be factored out in a satisfactory manner, and said the effect of carbon fertilization is well under 10%.

Minister Mabudhafasi said differences remained regarding: the name and composition of the intergovernmental consultative group of experts; the reporting and review activities and needs under UNFCCC Article 4.5; the <span class=""highlight"">development</span> of an information clearing-house and <span class=""highlight"">technology</span> centres network. Minister Auken said agreement on the issue of <span class=""highlight"">funding</span> would enable agreement on many of the outstanding issues, and stressed apparent <span class=""highlight"">flexibility</span> in the views on the <span class=""highlight"">GEF</span>, indicating that other possibilities for new and additional <span class=""highlight"">funding</span> were being explored by Parties. However, he said that much remained unresolved on <span class=""highlight"">adverse effects</span>, and informal contact groups had been formed to deal with specific issues. JAPAN, supported by CANADA, announced the tabling of a draft proposal by the Umbrella Group on the creation of a new window in <span class=""highlight"">GEF</span> to channel <span class=""highlight"">funding</span> for the issues discussed in Box A; the streamlining of the <span class=""highlight"">GEF</span>; and special consideration for <span class=""highlight"">LDCs</span> and <span class=""highlight"">SIDS</span>. IRAN noted this proposal and said that, dependent on the sentiment within the G-77/ CHINA, it provided ground for further movement on this issue. ARGENTINA said that <span class=""highlight"">emissions</span> reductions should be the priority objective of the negotiations and that the Umbrella GroupÂ’s draft proposal was confusion on priorities."

She highlighted the remaining divergent positions on the issues of <span class=""highlight"">supplementarity</span>, and said the EU had expressed interest in a possible qualitative ceiling. On fungibility and assigned amounts, she reported that India and the US were conducting consultations. On <span class=""highlight"">CDM</span>, she said the majority opposed an indicative list of projects. She added that France, Korea, Brazil and Norway were working on the issue of a <span class=""highlight"">prompt start</span> and that divergence remained on a possible unilateral <span class=""highlight"">CDM</span>. Consultations were also being held between the US and India on the composition of the Executive Board, and between China, Norway and Canada on the possible role of multilateral <span class=""highlight"">funding</span> institutions. In response to a question by the US on the allocation of the issue of <span class=""highlight"">sinks</span> under the <span class=""highlight"">CDM</span>, President Pronk said he would consult with the co-facilitators of both groups and then issue a ruling. The EU said that although there was a majority against it, the option of having a positive list of activities under the <span class=""highlight"">CDM</span> should remain on the table."
cdm|additionality|supplementarity|lulucf|sink,"Discussions then continued in the afternoon during closed informal consultations. Following this, delegates heard a further progress report in the evening session of the informal high-level Plenary. Reporting on the informal consultations, Ministers Sardenberg (Brazil) and Kawaguchi noted that while there had been some progress on eligibility and financial <span class=""highlight"">additionality</span>, there had been insufficient progress on liability, <span class=""highlight"">supplementarity</span>, and the composition of the Executive Board and its relationship with COP/ MOP. Sardenberg noted that ongoing consultations are taking place on the issue of unilateral projects, and on the role of multilateral institutions. Regarding the eligibility of projects, he said the majority of Parties opposed a list. He noted some support on the use of <span class=""highlight"">ODA</span> financing in the <span class=""highlight"">CDM</span> if this is additional to current <span class=""highlight"">ODA</span> levels. He noted growing agreement on the role of small projects that may benefit from a fast track, although technical details needed to be resolved. He said there were diverse views on the eligibility of <span class=""highlight"">LULUCF</span> projects, both on substance as well as whether the mechanisms group was the most appropriate forum. SAUDI ARABIA called for clarity on what is meant by financing that is additional to current <span class=""highlight"">ODA</span>. SAMOA called for levying a share of proceeds on all three mechanisms. CHINA underlined that there remains disagreement on the issue of unilateral or bilateral projects, and on the possible limited inclusion of <span class=""highlight"">sinks</span> in the <span class=""highlight"">CDM</span>."
cdm|lulucf,"BOX C Â– <span class=""highlight"">LULUCF</span>:   Negotiators involved in discussions on <span class=""highlight"">LULUCF</span> met in the afternoon and again in the evening for informal consultations co-facilitated by Minister Carabias Lillo (Mexico) and Minister MiklÃ³s (Slovakia). In the evening, the co-facilitators reported back to the informal high-level Plenary on progress. Minister Carabias Lillo said the group in the afternoon had explored different conditions for including Article 3.4 activities, possibly even in the first commitment period, under controlled conditions. She explained that bilateral meetings had been held with the aim of exploring an approach to this, but the issue had not yet been resolved. She said the second meeting in the evening had focused on the inclusion of <span class=""highlight"">LULUCF</span> activities under the <span class=""highlight"">CDM</span>, and some agreement as well as concerns had emerged. She noted that the group would be able to bring forward proposals on the issues, but more time was needed."

POLAND, for the CENTRAL GROUP ELEVEN, said the treatment of non-compliance should not be based on the Parties, but on the nature of the commitment. With the RUSSIAN FEDERATION, she called for <span class=""highlight"">flexibility</span> for countries with <span class=""highlight"">economies in transition</span>. CHINA highlighted that a strict <span class=""highlight"">compliance system</span> should be based on Protocol Articles 5, 7 and 8, and that Annex I PartiesÃ¯Â¿Â½ reports should include information on Protocol Articles 10 (existing commitments) and 11 (<span class=""highlight"">financial mechanism</span>), including in relation to additional <span class=""highlight"">financial resources</span>. He added that the different responsibilities of Annex I and non-Annex I Parties should be reflected in the sections on principles, mandate and consequences. He concluded by raising the issue of the bodiesÃ¯Â¿Â½ composition and called for adherence to the principles of fairness and equitable geographical representation. Pronk said the question of composition was a cross-cutting issue. SWITZERLAND said the integrity of the review process requires that the competence of reviewers be a priority, and suggested training as a way to reach both this objective and ensure equitable geographical representation. Following a question by President Pronk, he said it was reasonable to have full representation in only one of the two branches of the <span class=""highlight"">compliance committee</span>."
private sector|binding commitments|compliance system,"ARGENTINA expressed concern over the adoption of a <span class=""highlight"">compliance regime</span> and a possible amendment of the Protocol before its <span class=""highlight"">entry into force</span>. Opposed by BRAZIL, he called on Parties not to push for the most comprehensive and complex regime, but one that will be viable. On consequences, he said good faith should constitute the main source of confidence in this agreement. The US said legally-<span class=""highlight"">binding consequences</span> need not be <span class=""highlight"">punitive</span> and highlighted that she supported a deduction from the following commitment period with a 1.3% penalty rate as well as a restriction on the transfer of units also applicable to Protocol Article 4 (joint fulfilment) Parties. The EU argued that Article 4 is not a mechanism and, commenting on ARGENTINAÃ¯Â¿Â½s intervention, said good faith it not sufficient due to inclusion of market-based mechanisms in the Protocol. He explained that legally-<span class=""highlight"">binding consequences</span> were thus justified both by concerns over the environmental integrity of the Protocol, as well as by the necessity to provide the <span class=""highlight"">private sector</span> with the confidence needed for the use of the mechanisms. He added that the rate of deduction should fluctuate between 1 and 1.5% and would constitute an incentive for the Party concerned to use the true-up period to take advantage of the market. CANADA said legally-<span class=""highlight"">binding consequences</span> were also justified on competitiveness grounds. Pronk concluded that good faith and economics should thus guide the consequences to be adopted. The G-77/CHINA stressed that non-compliance affects everyone, and not only the trading partners of Annex I Parties. She urged that this must be reflected in the composition of the <span class=""highlight"">compliance committee</span>."
adverse effects/impacts|funding|compliance system,"AUSTRALIA and the RUSSIAN FEDERATION argued for a non-binding regime and said their countries were more concerned about their own compliance than that of others. Supporting AUSTRALIA, JAPAN explained that its main trading partners were not the other Annex I Parties but non-Annex I Asian countries. CANADA supported the voluntary payments to a <span class=""highlight"">compliance fund to deal with mitigation projects. IRAN said such a fund should also minimize the adverse impact of response measures. AOSIS said payment in a voluntary fund would actually provide Parties with an additional flexible mechanism.</span>"
adverse effects/impacts|policies and measures,"On <span class=""highlight"">policies and measures</span> (<span class=""highlight"">P&amp;Ms</span>), the EU said the participation of non-Annex I Parties in workshops would allow for a valuable exchange of information. He said the <span class=""highlight"">emissions</span> inventories alone are not comprehensive enough to assess <span class=""highlight"">demonstrable progress</span> in 2005, and suggested a COP-7 decision on the information needed in this regard. The G-77/CHINA said the whole of Protocol Article 2 - including provision for minimizing <span class=""highlight"">adverse effects</span> - should be referred to in the decision. He suggested keeping the reference to Annex I Parties, as non-Annex I Parties would otherwise be required to implement these obligations."
supplementarity|adverse effects/impacts|policies and measures,"Delegates also met in closed informal consultations on these issues in the afternoon, although the meeting was cut short when protestors entered the room and disrupted negotiations. The consultations were reconvened in the early evening prior to the informal high-level Plenary, where participants heard a report on progress. In the Plenary, co-facilitator Minister Bjerke (Norway) highlighted a constructive dialogue and the need for more time, given the interruption of its work. On <span class=""highlight"">demonstrable progress</span> she said discussions had focused on what to report and when. She added that a smaller group had identified a possible compromise. This option decides that consideration of <span class=""highlight"">demonstrable progress</span> cannot take place until SBSTA has considered this issue pursuant to guidelines that may be elaborated under Article 7, given that Articles 2 and 3.2 provide no mandate for <span class=""highlight"">P&amp;Ms</span> to be considered in the context of <span class=""highlight"">demonstrable progress</span>. She said issues of reporting on Protocol Article 3.14 (<span class=""highlight"">adverse effects</span>) and on <span class=""highlight"">supplementarity</span> were not resolved yet and that consultations on Protocol Article 4 (joint fulfillment) were ongoing. On compliance, she reported that discussions had focused on consequences."
compliance system|expert review,"In the discussion that followed, SAUDI ARABIA said the composition of the <span class=""highlight"">expert review</span> teams and issues relating to Article 3.14 still needed consideration. The EU said a strong <span class=""highlight"">compliance regime</span> was a fundamental requirement and AOSIS highlighted the importance it attaches to this issue."
supplementarity|lulucf,"Meanwhile, the substantive discussions showed signs of movement, as both multilateral and bilateral discussions moved up a gear. Several observers reported a softening on the EU position on several issues, including <span class=""highlight"">supplementarity</span> and share of proceeds. In addition, there was talk of one Umbrella Group member taking a softer line on <span class=""highlight"">supplementarity</span>, in return for <span class=""highlight"">flexibility</span> on <span class=""highlight"">LULUCF</span>."

On <span class=""highlight"">adverse effects</span>, Minister Auken said there was deadlock on key issues, and that assistance from contact group co-chairs Salamat and KjellÃ©n had been requested. He also said a separate EU proposal on financial issues had been presented and that, along with the proposal submitted by the Umbrella Group, there was substantial material on which to negotiate."
cdm|additionality|supplementarity,"BOX B Â– MECHANISMS:   Co-facilitator Minister Kawaguchi said there were too many issues to deal with. She said agreement was near on details relating to the <span class=""highlight"">CDM</span>, including: financial <span class=""highlight"">additionality</span>; fast track on small projects; use of share of proceeds from <span class=""highlight"">CDM</span> for adaptation; environmental <span class=""highlight"">additionality</span>; no list for project eligibility. Composition of the Executive Board and its relationship with the COP/MOP remained undecided. She noted progress on <span class=""highlight"">emissions</span> trading, registries and participation, but indicated that no agreement had been reached on liability. On the cross-cutting issues, she stated that there was agreement on eligibility of Annex I Parties to use mechanisms, but disagreement on how to use share of proceeds, as well as on fungibility and <span class=""highlight"">supplementarity</span>. On <span class=""highlight"">joint implementation</span> (<span class=""highlight"">JI</span>), Parties were still unable to agree on whether rules and guidelines should be identical to the <span class=""highlight"">CDM</span>, and whether there should be a two-track approach."
cdm|lulucf|additional activities,"BOX C Â– <span class=""highlight"">LULUCF</span>:   Minister Carabias Lillo said the informal group on <span class=""highlight"">LULUCF</span> had split into two sub-groups the night before, with one group focusing on the analysis of Article 3.4 (<span class=""highlight"">additional activities</span>), and the other on the inclusion of <span class=""highlight"">LULUCF</span> activities under the <span class=""highlight"">CDM</span>. On the work of the former, she said ideas had been discussed for discounting some elements, such as pre-1990 carbon uptake. On the latter, she reported a common view within the group on the need to address permanence, and that discussions had focused on the possibility for further SBSTA consideration, with <span class=""highlight"">IPCC</span> input, on this matter. She said approaches for a first <span class=""highlight"">pilot phase</span> of limited <span class=""highlight"">LULUCF</span> projects had been considered. She said the <span class=""highlight"">LULUCF</span> group had now reached its limits, and there was little prospect of convergence."
expert review,"BOX D Â– COMPLIANCE, <span class=""highlight"">POLICIES AND MEASURES</span>, AND ACCOUNTING, REPORTING AND REVIEW UNDER PROTOCOL ARTICLES 5, 7, AND 8:   Minister Bjerke reported on the work carried out in the informal small groups. On Articles 5 (methodological issues), 7 (communication of information) and 8 (review of information), she said text on reporting under Protocol Articles 10 (existing commitments) and 11 (<span class=""highlight"">financial mechanism</span>) had been elaborated, and the only bracket remaining in the decision on Article 8 related to the composition of the <span class=""highlight"">expert review</span> teams. She said further brackets remained on issues that were dependent on the outcome of other groups."
compliance system,"On <span class=""highlight"">demonstrable progress</span>, she said the group had converged around the idea that reporting should take place in 2005, as a report separate from national communications. Regarding compliance, she said discussions had focused on the establishment and structure of the <span class=""highlight"">compliance committee</span>, the functions of the plenary, as well as on how principles could be reflected in the compliance text. She noted that more time was needed, as not all the crunch issues had been resolved."
cdm|buenos aires programme of work|gef|funding|adaptation fund|ldcs,"President Pronk noted a greater divergence of opinion than he had expected, and said there were three elements in the reports Â– those issues that had been agreed, those close to agreement, and those on which no agreement is currently foreseeable. He said he would summarize the issues in a paper that ministers would be invited to collect at his office, to ensure that he would also be able to conduct bilateral discussions with each group. Responding to President PronkÂ’s proposal, the G-77/CHINA noted that developing countries have the highest stakes in these negotiations, and that the total package, as in the <span class=""highlight"">Buenos Aires Plan of Action</span>, would need to be reflected. On the Umbrella GroupÂ’s <span class=""highlight"">funding</span> proposal and the alternative put forward by the EU, he said they represent a step forward but still require more negotiation. He stressed that the ball is in the court of developed countries, saying they have the economic resources and have caused the problem, and therefore it is their responsibility to resolve this. The EU highlighted its <span class=""highlight"">funding</span> proposal, which focuses on the need to improve and increase <span class=""highlight"">funding</span> for the <span class=""highlight"">GEF</span>, especially taking into consideration the needs of <span class=""highlight"">least developed countries</span> (<span class=""highlight"">LDCs</span>), and suggests an adaptation <span class=""highlight"">fund</span> plus within the existing <span class=""highlight"">GEF</span> structure. She said <span class=""highlight"">funding</span> should be derived not only from a <span class=""highlight"">CDM</span> levy, but also from contributions, and added that assuring stable sources of <span class=""highlight"">funding</span> was crucial."

The note further puts forward actions by Annex II Parties to address impacts of response measures on non-Annex I Parties under UNFCCC Article 4.8, through concrete actions based on, _inter alia, _further methodological work in <span class=""highlight"">economic diversification</span>, increasing <span class=""highlight"">energy</span> efficiency in fossil <span class=""highlight"">fuel</span> production, and advanced fossil <span class=""highlight"">fuel</span> technologies.

Following intense negotiations at COP-3, held in Kyoto, Japan in December 1997, delegates agreed to a Protocol to the UNFCCC that commits developed countries and countries making the transition to a market economy to achieve quantified targets for decreasing their <span class=""highlight"">emissions</span> of greenhouse <span class=""highlight"">gases</span>. These countries, known under the UNFCCC as Annex I Parties, committed themselves to reducing their overall <span class=""highlight"">emissions</span> of six greenhouse <span class=""highlight"">gases</span> by at least 5% below <span class=""highlight"">1990 levels</span> over the period between 2008 and 2012, with specific targets varying from country to country. The Protocol also provided the basis for three mechanisms to assist Annex I Parties in meeting their national targets cost-effectively Â– an <span class=""highlight"">emissions</span> trading system, <span class=""highlight"">joint implementation</span> (<span class=""highlight"">JI</span>) of <span class=""highlight"">emissions</span>-reduction projects between Annex I Parties, and a <span class=""highlight"">Clean Development Mechanism</span> (<span class=""highlight"">CDM</span>) to encourage joint projects between Annex I and non-Annex I (developing country) Parties. However, it was left for subsequent meetings to decide on most of the rules and operational details that will determine how these cuts in <span class=""highlight"">emissions</span> are achieved and how countriesÂ’ efforts are measured and assessed. Although some countries have signed the Protocol, most are waiting until these operational details are negotiated before deciding whether to ratify. To enter into force, the Protocol must be ratified by 55 Parties to the UNFCCC, including Annex I Parties representing at least 55% of the total <span class=""highlight"">carbon dioxide</span> <span class=""highlight"">emissions</span> for 1990. To date, 34 Parties have ratified the Protocol."

This work schedule was outlined in a document called the <span class=""highlight"">Buenos Aires Plan of Action</span>. The critical deadline under the Plan of Action was COP-6, where Parties were to attempt to reach agreement on a package of issues. Critical Protocol-related issues needing resolution included rules relating to the mechanisms, a regime for assessing PartiesÂ’ compliance, and accounting methods for national <span class=""highlight"">emissions</span> and <span class=""highlight"">emissions</span> reductions. Rules on crediting countries for <span class=""highlight"">carbon sinks were also to be addressed. Issues under the UNFCCC requiring resolution included questions of capacity building, the transfer and development of technology, and assistance to those developing countries that are especially vulnerable to the adverse effects of climate change or to actions taken by industrialized countries to combat climate change.</span>"

During the second week of negotiations, COP-6 President Jan Pronk of the Netherlands attempted to facilitate progress on the many disputed political and technical issues by convening high-level informal Plenary sessions to address the key political issues, which he grouped into four clusters or boxes, as follows: (a) capacity building, <span class=""highlight"">technology</span> transfer, <span class=""highlight"">adverse effects</span> and guidance to the <span class=""highlight"">financial mechanism</span>; (b) mechanisms; (c) <span class=""highlight"">land use</span>, <span class=""highlight"">land-use</span> change and <span class=""highlight"">forestry</span> (<span class=""highlight"">LULUCF</span>); and, (d) compliance, <span class=""highlight"">policies and measures</span>, and accounting, reporting and review under UNFCCC Articles 5 (methodological issues), 7 (communication of information) and 8 (review of information). Ministers and other senior negotiators convened in four groups to negotiate on these clusters in an attempt to reach consensus."
supplementarity|lulucf,"However, by Thursday, 23 November, negotiations appeared stalled, and President Pronk distributed a Note containing his proposals on key issues in an attempt to encourage a breakthrough. After almost 36 hours of intense talks on the PresidentÂ’s proposals, negotiators could not achieve an agreement, with financial issues, <span class=""highlight"">supplementarity</span> in the use of the mechanisms, compliance and <span class=""highlight"">LULUCF</span> proving to be particular sticking points. On Saturday afternoon, 25 November, President Pronk convened a final high-level informal Plenary in which he announced that delegates had failed to reach agreement. Delegates agreed to suspend COP-6, and expressed a willingness to resume their work in 2001."
cdm|nuclear|funding|lulucf|sink,"While some participants expressed the opinion that positions did not appear to have shifted since COP-6 Part I, others underscored that positions had possibly widened. They also noted signs of entrenchment by some Parties, in particular on the subjects of <span class=""highlight"">LULUCF</span>, <span class=""highlight"">sinks</span> in the <span class=""highlight"">CDM</span>, and the use of <span class=""highlight"">nuclear</span> power to meet commitments. The <span class=""highlight"">funding</span> issue also appeared to be a potential barrier that could create problems. Further rumblings were caused by Japan's ambiguity regarding its intentions for ratifying the Protocol. Participants also expressed hope that President Pronk would take a stronger leadership role, and provide more guidance, rather than encouraging excessive discussion on difficult subjects."
buenos aires programme of work|lulucf|technology|technology transfer,"In addition, an unbracketed consolidated negotiating text proposed in June by President Pronk is likely to serve as a key tool for supporting the negotiations. This text addresses critical areas where disagreements remain, and attempts to establish a balanced package of decisions on all issues covered by the <span class=""highlight"">Buenos Aires Plan of Action</span>. The text tackles questions related to finance, <span class=""highlight"">technology</span> transfer, adaptation, capacity-building, UNFCCC Article 4.8 and 4.9 and Protocol Article 3.14 (<span class=""highlight"">adverse effects</span>), the mechanisms, <span class=""highlight"">LULUCF</span>, compliance, and governance of new bodies."
funding|emission|co2,"Financial issues:   The consolidated negotiating text deals with the procedure for allocating resources to <span class=""highlight"">fund</span> activities in non-Annex I Parties. One key proposal in the text is that Annex I Parties contribute US$ one billion annually by 2005 at the latest, based on countriesÃ¯Â¿Â½ relative share of total <span class=""highlight"">carbon dioxide</span> <span class=""highlight"">emissions</span> in 1990, with a 50% discount for countries making the transition to a market economy."
supplementarity|cdm|lulucf|afforestation|reforestation,"Mechanisms:   The consolidated negotiating text addresses controversial issues such as <span class=""highlight"">supplementarity</span> and eligibility to participate in the mechanisms. The text also tackles the issue of which <span class=""highlight"">LULUCF</span> projects might be permitted under the <span class=""highlight"">CDM</span> during the first commitment period by suggesting that this should be limited to <span class=""highlight"">afforestation</span> and <span class=""highlight"">reforestation</span> projects."
agriculture|forest management|forest|reforestation|lulucf|afforestation,"<span class=""highlight"">LULUCF</span>:   The text outlines a complex compromise package, including text on <span class=""highlight"">accounting rules</span> for eligible activities under Protocol Article 3.4 (additional human activities such as <span class=""highlight"">forest</span> management and <span class=""highlight"">agricultural</span> land management) that involve: <span class=""highlight"">compensation</span> of possible Article 3.3 (<span class=""highlight"">afforestation</span>, <span class=""highlight"">reforestation</span> and <span class=""highlight"">deforestation</span>) debits through accounting for <span class=""highlight"">forest</span> management of up to 8.2 megatons of carbon annually per Party, with no discount applied to Article 3.4 credits up to this level; an 85 percent discount on <span class=""highlight"">forest</span> management activities beyond the first tier; and net-net accounting for <span class=""highlight"">agricultural</span> management."

Delegates met in the morning for an opening Plenary session to address organizational matters. In the afternoon and evening, Parties convened in negotiating groups to discuss: finance, <span class=""highlight"">technology</span> transfer, adaptation, capacity building, and <span class=""highlight"">adverse effects</span>; mechanisms; and <span class=""highlight"">land use</span>, <span class=""highlight"">land-use</span> change and <span class=""highlight"">forestry</span> (<span class=""highlight"">LULUCF</span>)."
land-use change|land use|lulucf|forestry|technology transfer|technology,"On the organization of work, delegates agreed to establish four negotiating groups on the following issues: finance, <span class=""highlight"">technology</span> transfer, adaptation, capacity building, and <span class=""highlight"">adverse effects</span>, chaired by John Ashe (Antigua and Barbuda) and Andrej Kranjc (Slovenia); mechanisms, chaired by Raul Estrada- Oyuela (Argentina) and Kok Kee Chow (Malaysia); <span class=""highlight"">land use</span>, <span class=""highlight"">land-use</span> change and <span class=""highlight"">forestry</span> (<span class=""highlight"">LULUCF</span>), chaired by Harald Dovland (Norway) and Philip Gwage (Uganda); and compliance, chaired by Tuiloma Neroni Slade (Samoa) and Harald Dovland. President Pronk noted that additional resource people Â– delegates experienced on these specific questions Â– would assist the chairs. He indicated that a further negotiating group may be established later on UNFCCC Articles 5 (methodological issues), 7 (communication of information) and 8 (review of information)."
lulucf|sink|additional activities,"<span class=""highlight"">LULUCF</span>:   Co-Chair Dovland encouraged the <span class=""highlight"">LULUCF</span> negotiating group to exchange views on Protocol Article 3.4 (<span class=""highlight"">additional activities</span>). BRAZIL, for the G-77/CHINA, said President PronkÂ’s consolidated negotiating text represented a reconsideration of Annex I Party commitments, and highlighted concerns that the definition of <span class=""highlight"">additional activities</span> under Article 3.4 creates a precedent for unlimited enlargement of the ProtocolÂ’s scope in the future. She said <span class=""highlight"">emissions</span> by sources and removal by <span class=""highlight"">sinks</span> due to <span class=""highlight"">LULUCF</span> activities should be treated symmetrically, and that windfall effects should be factored out."
sink|lulucf,"Many delegates underscored the scale of credits available for <span class=""highlight"">sinks</span> as a key issue for the first commitment period. AUSTRALIA and CANADA supported the Pronk text as a good starting point in this regard, stressing that <span class=""highlight"">LULUCF</span> is fundamental for countries considering ratification. CANADA said it is working on a more country-specific proposal for moving forward on this issue. The EU highlighted scale as a problem but, with NORWAY and SWITZERLAND for the ENVIRONMENTAL INTEGRITY GROUP, stressed that the Pronk proposal represents a sound basis for negotiation."
forest|forest management,"TUVALU opposed including Protocol Article 3.4 activities during the first commitment period, as proposed in the Pronk text, stressing that it represents a renegotiation of the Kyoto targets and undermines the integrity of the Protocol. THAILAND said Article 3.4 activities should not be included until there is more scientific certainty. BRAZIL, supported by CHINA, NAURU and INDIA, stressed concerns with regard to the integrity of the Protocol if too liberal an interpretation is applied to activities under Article 3.4. On definitions, AUSTRALIA, JAPAN and CANADA said <span class=""highlight"">forest</span> management warrants further consideration."
adverse effects/impacts|financial mechanism|technology|technology transfer,"FINANCIAL ISSUES:   The negotiating group on financial issues, including capacity building, <span class=""highlight"">technology</span> transfer, adaptation, UNFCCC Article 4.8 and 4.9 and Protocol Articles 2.3 and 3.14 (<span class=""highlight"">adverse effects</span>), met in the afternoon to consider the negotiating text on capacity building and the text on guidance to the <span class=""highlight"">financial mechanism</span>. It reconvened in the evening to discuss the text on <span class=""highlight"">adverse effects</span>."
napa|financial resources|financial mechanism,"In the afternoon session, delegates discussed bracketed text in the Annex to the draft decision on capacity building in developing countries. Parties disagreed over the placement of several paragraphs that addressed guidance to the <span class=""highlight"">financial mechanism</span>. On <span class=""highlight"">financial resources</span> for the implementation of Stage II adaptation activities, delegates agreed to a proposal by CANADA to refer to national <span class=""highlight"">adaptation plans</span> of action (<span class=""highlight"">NAPAs</span>)."
funding|financial resources|gef,"On the <span class=""highlight"">funding</span> of capacity building for <span class=""highlight"">disasters</span> related to climate change, the EU, NORWAY and the US, opposed by the G-77/CHINA, expressed concern about overburdening the <span class=""highlight"">GEF</span>. The US suggested deleting reference to the building of institutional capacity, while the EU proposed that capacity building not include the management of <span class=""highlight"">disasters</span>. Co-Chair Ashe suggested that the <span class=""highlight"">GEF</span> shall provide <span class=""highlight"">financial resources</span> to build institutional capacity where appropriate and that the <span class=""highlight"">funding</span> of the management of <span class=""highlight"">disasters</span> be put in brackets. The text, as amended by Co-Chair Ashe, was set aside for discussion at a later date."
funding,"On early warning systems, the EU, opposed by the G-77/ CHINA, suggested deleting the reference to the <span class=""highlight"">funding</span> for the establishment, where needed, of such systems. Co-Chair Ashe bracketed the text accordingly."
funding|gef,"On text requesting the <span class=""highlight"">GEF</span> to provide <span class=""highlight"">funding</span> for the implementation of the capacity building framework, the G-77/CHINA suggested that the language agreed upon in the draft decision on capacity building should replace the current text. The US, with the EU, preferred working on the basis of the current text. The US also expressed concern at placing all responsibility of implementation on the <span class=""highlight"">GEF</span>, proposing instead that this entity support the implementation, rather than implement, the framework. Co-Chair Ashe suggested both texts be discussed at a later stage, and expressed concern at the lack of significant progress."
ldcs,"On text referring to the specific concerns of <span class=""highlight"">least developed countries</span> (<span class=""highlight"">LDCs</span>) on adaptation activities, UGANDA, supported by SENEGAL and MALI, emphasized the inclusion of this reference. The G-77/CHINA said this reference was redundant due to the new terms of reference of the <span class=""highlight"">LDC</span> group of experts text, which would be integrated into the negotiating text. The EU suggested retaining the brackets around this reference."
funding|adverse effects/impacts|gef,"On Section B under <span class=""highlight"">adverse effects</span> of climate change, several delegates noted agreement on the text, although overall issues related to <span class=""highlight"">funding</span> would have to be resolved before the brackets could be removed. CANADA said those activities to be covered by the <span class=""highlight"">GEF</span> would have to be differentiated from those that are not. The G-77/CHINA noted the need to separate <span class=""highlight"">funds</span> related to the UNFCCC and the Protocol. The US said it will contribute to UNFCCC activities, adding that it will be useful to consider how <span class=""highlight"">funds</span> can be co-mingled with other sources."
cdm,"MECHANISMS:   The mechanisms group met in the evening, to discuss text on the modalities and procedures for the <span class=""highlight"">CDM</span>. Delegates sought areas for agreement by comparing PronkÂ’s proposed text with negotiating text carried forward from The Hague. They agreed to commence discussions on the three separate decisions on mechanisms, noting that this would not prejudice whether there would be one or three decisions. On the role of the COP/MOP, some support was expressed for PronkÂ’s proposed text. Diverging views were expressed on the composition of the Executive Board, and discussion on this issue was deferred."
cdm|sink,"On accreditation and designation of <span class=""highlight"">operational entities</span>, NORWAY supported PronkÂ’s text subject to minor technical issues. SAMOA and TANZANIA underlined concerns with the inclusion of <span class=""highlight"">sinks</span> in the <span class=""highlight"">CDM</span>. The EU said the <span class=""highlight"">sinks</span> issue must be decided at a high political level."
cers|cdm,"On eligibility, Co-Chair Estrada noted that this was completely reformulated in the Pronk text, which aimed to combine the various options. JAPAN proposed deleting the notion of project eligibility. NORWAY, SWITZERLAND, the REPUBLIC OF KOREA and the EU expressed general support for the Pronk proposal. The EU and CHINA requested including reference to <span class=""highlight"">CDM</span> being a partnership between Annex I and non-Annex I Parties. JAPAN, NIGERIA and the US expressed concern with the requirement that an Annex I PartyÃ¯Â¿Â½s use of <span class=""highlight"">CERs</span> is conditional on it being a Party to the Agreement on Procedures and Mechanisms on Compliance supplementing the <span class=""highlight"">Kyoto Protocol</span> to the UNFCCC.

AUSTRALIA, JAPAN and CANADA opposed text requiring environmental <span class=""highlight"">impact assessments</span> for every project activity. AUSTRALIA and JAPAN, opposed by SAMOA, disagreed with preferential treatment on the crediting period for small-scale project activities. CHINA urged provision for <span class=""highlight"">technology</span> transfer and environmental <span class=""highlight"">additionality</span>. TUVALU proposed bracketing reference to <span class=""highlight"">leakage</span>. On <span class=""highlight"">supplementarity</span>, NIGERIA sought clarity on reference to Annex I Parties meeting <span class=""highlight"">emissions</span> <span class=""highlight"">reduction commitments</span> chiefly through <span class=""highlight"">domestic action</span>, and underlined the importance of <span class=""highlight"">equitable geographic distribution</span> of <span class=""highlight"">CDM</span> projects.

lulucf|forestry|land use|land-use change,"Delegates to the resumed Sixth Conference of the Parties to the UNFCCC met in negotiating groups in the morning, afternoon and evening to discuss: compliance; mechanisms; financial issues; and <span class=""highlight"">land use</span>, <span class=""highlight"">land-use</span> change and <span class=""highlight"">forestry</span> (<span class=""highlight"">LULUCF</span>)."
compliance system|enforcement|facilitative branch,"COMPLIANCE:   Co-Chair Slade suggested that delegates focus on five issues: consequences applied by the <span class=""highlight"">enforcement</span> branch; composition; appeal; relationship between the <span class=""highlight"">Compliance Committee</span> and the COP/MOP; and principles. Developing countries also stated that unresolved matters include the operation of the <span class=""highlight"">facilitative branch</span>, as proposed in PronkÂ’s text."
binding commitments|assigned amount units,"On consequences, delegates discussed their nature and whether they would be <span class=""highlight"">legally binding</span>. A group of Annex I Parties favored a <span class=""highlight"">legally binding</span> system with rather tough consequences to deter Parties from becoming free-riders. Non-Annex I countries, with others, said legally <span class=""highlight"">binding consequences</span> are necessary to address legally <span class=""highlight"">binding commitments</span>. They said the consequences should be tailored to achieve three objectives: deterrence, restoration, and ensuring that Parties continue meeting their responsibilities over the next commitment periods. Some developed countries supported politically-agreed consequences of a non-<span class=""highlight"">punitive</span> nature, while others favored a <span class=""highlight"">legally binding</span> regime with a facilitative, non-<span class=""highlight"">punitive</span> approach. One delegate explained that what is <span class=""highlight"">punitive</span> reflects PartiesÂ’ own perceptions of consequences. One developed country, opposed by several developing countries, argued against restricting the right to transfer <span class=""highlight"">assigned amount units</span>, and suggested that the restoration rate of excess tonnes be one for one. A consultation group, chaired by JosÃ© Romero (Switzerland), was established to follow up on this matter. This group met from late afternoon, and established a list of unresolved issues with possible options for consideration by Ministers. It will report back to the Co-Chairs by Wednesday, 17 July, 12:00 pm."
enforcement,"On the composition of compliance bodies, numerous Parties opposed the single type of formula proposed in PronkÂ’s text. Developing country Parties said the composition criterion should be the equitable geographic representation of the five UN regional groupings, taking into account the interest groups as reflected by the current practice in the UNFCCC Bureau. One developing country explained that this composition would reflect the fact that the whole community of states had an interest in ensuring compliance. A number of Annex I Parties said the composition should be tailored to the mandate of the branch and to the type of commitments under consideration. One developed country suggested that, given the quasi-judicial functions of the <span class=""highlight"">enforcement</span> branch, there was a very strong case to move away from drawing analogies with political bodies, and that only Annex I Parties should sit on this branch. Another developed country said it would submit a proposal on this issue at a later stage."
facilitative branch,"On principles, non-Annex I Parties expressed their opposition to the approach taken in the Pronk text. They said the <span class=""highlight"">facilitative branch</span> should treat Annex I and non-Annex I Parties differently and apply different consequences to these two groups. A number of Annex I Parties supported PronkÂ’s text, with some arguing that the principle of common but <span class=""highlight"">differentiated responsibilities</span> does not only apply between Annex I and non-Annex I Parties."
compliance system,"On appeal, delegates expressed diverging views. On the relationship between the <span class=""highlight"">Compliance Committee</span> and the COP/MOP, developing countries said the issue was closely related to the possibility of an appeal and of a panel to consider the reports of experts review teams."
cdm|supplementarity|cer|cers|funding|adaptation fund,"Regarding participation in project activities under the <span class=""highlight"">Clean Development Mechanism</span> (<span class=""highlight"">CDM</span>), several developing countries welcomed the removal from PronkÂ’s text of the requirement to submit national communications. On the issuance of <span class=""highlight"">certified emission reductions</span> (<span class=""highlight"">CERs</span>), a developing country questioned the involvement of <span class=""highlight"">CDM</span> institutions in distribution activities, and said 15 days was too short for issuing <span class=""highlight"">CERs</span>. A developing country expressed concern with the provisions in the Pronk text on the adaptation <span class=""highlight"">fund</span>. On <span class=""highlight"">supplementarity</span> and environmental integrity, a developing country called for new proposals, and noted an earlier proposal by one Annex I Party on dealing with surplus assigned amounts."
cdm|supplementarity|reducing emissions|emission|economies in transition|eit|emissions trading,"On <span class=""highlight"">Joint Implementation</span> (<span class=""highlight"">JI</span>), most Annex I Parties supported the two-track approach adopted in the Pronk text, but differed on the establishment of a supervisory committee for verifying <span class=""highlight"">emissions</span> reduction units. A number of countries with <span class=""highlight"">economies in transition</span>, opposed by various developing countries, called for the <span class=""highlight"">development</span> of appendices on the procedural elements for <span class=""highlight"">JI</span> during this meeting. On <span class=""highlight"">emissions</span> trading, delegates failed to agree on the level of the commitment period reserve. Developing countries underlined their concerns with <span class=""highlight"">supplementarity</span> and the adaptation levy, and with the unequal rules governing <span class=""highlight"">CDM</span> and trading. On <span class=""highlight"">supplementarity</span>, a grouping of Annex I Parties indicated a possible willingness to compromise in favor of the Pronk proposal."
additionality|forest management|forest|lulucf,"<span class=""highlight"">LULUCF</span>:   This group met in afternoon and evening sessions. During the afternoon, delegates were presented with a joint proposal from Canada, Australia and Japan on the issue of scale in Article 3.4 <span class=""highlight"">forest</span> management, and a proposal by New Zealand addressing scale and <span class=""highlight"">additionality</span> in this context. The former proposal relies on negotiated maximum levels of allowable <span class=""highlight"">forest</span> management credits for individual countries, as opposed to the formula approach taken in the Pronk text, which includes caps and discount rates. It was presented as a clear and transparent approach, with levels set that account for: the PartyÂ’s <span class=""highlight"">national circumstances</span>; the degree of effort required by the Party to achieve its <span class=""highlight"">emissions</span> limitation; <span class=""highlight"">forest</span> management measures the Party is implementing or planning to implement; and whether it incurs a net source of <span class=""highlight"">emissions</span> under Article 3.3. It was noted that the proposal seeks to replace only parts of the Pronk text and should be viewed in concert with it. It applies to the first commitment period only. One country with an <span class=""highlight"">economy in transition</span> joined in supporting the proposal."
additional activities,"A number of developing countries stated that no <span class=""highlight"">additional activities</span> should be pursued under Article 3.4 during the first commitment period. One delegate said the proposal constitutes a renegotiation of the Protocol targets. Another Party stressed the need to retain the credibility of the process and assure long-run effective climate protection, and asked what the scale of the allowed credits might be. One delegate noted that negotiations on allowable credits should take place during the ministerial segment in order to pave the way for ratification. Some Parties stressed a compromise on Article 3.4 as a key to ratification."
cdm|forest management|forest|carbon stocks|sink,"The New Zealand proposal was presented as retaining market-based incentives for improved <span class=""highlight"">forest</span> management and <span class=""highlight"">CDM</span> activities. It suggests that a Party including Article 3.4 activities during the first commitment period either: demonstrates, in accordance with specific criteria, that additional or improved practices since 1990 have caused a marginal benefit to the atmosphere in comparison to what would have otherwise occurred; or accounts for net increases in <span class=""highlight"">carbon stocks</span> and net anthropogenic greenhouse <span class=""highlight"">gas</span> removals by <span class=""highlight"">sinks</span> up to a level to be negotiated on a country by country basis. In addition, a preliminary EU proposal was presented, supporting the Pronk text but reducing the scale of Article 3.4 activities."
technology|technology transfer,"On the preambular paragraphs of the draft decision, Parties agreed to use the three paragraphs proposed in President PronkÂ’s text. At the urging of developing countries, they added a fourth paragraph from The Hague text noting that the COP has considered the recommended framework, presented by the SBSTA Chair as part of the consultative process, for meaningful and effective actions to enhance the implementation of UNFCCC Article 4.5 (<span class=""highlight"">technology</span> transfer)."
technology|technology transfer,"Late afternoon, Parties met in a smaller drafting group to consider the institutional arrangements for <span class=""highlight"">technology</span> transfer. Delegates agreed to refer to a group rather than a panel of experts. They expressed diverging views on whether this group would be advisory or intergovernmental, on its composition, and whether it should assess and evaluate or merely facilitate the progress of <span class=""highlight"">technology</span> transfer."
adverse effects/impacts,"The negotiating group reconvened in the evening to discuss text relating to UNFCCC Article 4.8 and 4.9 and Protocol Articles 2.3 and 3.14 (<span class=""highlight"">adverse effects</span>). Proceeding through the text carried forward from The Hague, delegates were able to remove a number of brackets, including several in the section on the <span class=""highlight"">adverse effects</span> of climate change. Agreements included text on timing for a request to the SBSTA and SBI to review the progress of activities on <span class=""highlight"">adverse effects</span> outlined under this section, which delegates agreed should result in recommendations at COP-8. A number of brackets remained, however."
funding|ldcs,"Delegates then discussed the specific needs and special situations of the <span class=""highlight"">Least Developed Countries</span> (<span class=""highlight"">LDCs</span>), including text on the establishment of an <span class=""highlight"">LDC</span> climate change <span class=""highlight"">development</span> <span class=""highlight"">fund</span>/ programme. After lengthy discussion, delegates agreed to a suggestion by Co-Chair Dechen Tsering (Bhutan) that they consult informally on this and on some other <span class=""highlight"">funding</span>-related language."
lulucf,"<span class=""highlight"">LULUCF</span>:   Delegates will meet from 7:00-9:00 pm in Plenary II. Earlier in the day, the Co-Chairs will provide a conceptual paper setting out options for Ministers, which will be discussed during this evening session."

prompt start|cdm,"MECHANISMS:   The mechanisms group met in the morning and afternoon to identify and discuss the unresolved technical and political issues. Co-Chair Estrada raised the possibility that finalizing agreement on the appendices (relating to various administrative elements for implementation of the mechanisms) could be left for negotiation at COP-7. A number of developing and developed countries opposed this, emphasizing the importance of the appendices for issues such as a <span class=""highlight"">prompt start</span> of the <span class=""highlight"">CDM</span>."

nuclear|cdm|sink,"Delegates presented their views on the various options, with diverging opinions being expressed, in particular on those regarding: <span class=""highlight"">nuclear</span> in the <span class=""highlight"">CDM</span> and <span class=""highlight"">JI</span>; the establishment and composition of a supervisory committee; the level of the commitment period reserve; and <span class=""highlight"">sinks</span> in the <span class=""highlight"">CDM</span>. On this last issue, Co-Chair Estrada ruled against a request from a group of Annex I countries that an option be included providing for all <span class=""highlight"">sinks</span> project types within the <span class=""highlight"">CDM</span>."
equitable geographic distribution|cdm|additionality|cdm projects|distribution of cdm projects|funding|ldcs,"In the afternoon, delegates considered the following political issues identified by developing countries: the lack of parity between Annex I Parties under Article 4 (joint fulfillment) and other Parties; the need for special consideration for <span class=""highlight"">LDCs</span>; financial <span class=""highlight"">additionality</span>; and the <span class=""highlight"">equitable distribution</span> of <span class=""highlight"">CDM</span> projects on a geographical basis. Co-Chair Estrada proposed that clear options be presented for Ministers on Article 4, and that the remaining issues be addressed within the Co-ChairsÂ’ report to the Plenary. He ruled against a request from certain developing countries to include reference in the report to an <span class=""highlight"">equitable distribution</span> <span class=""highlight"">fund</span>, but undertook to raise this issue orally in his presentation to Plenary."
enforcement,"COMPLIANCE:   On Wednesday afternoon, delegates heard a report from Chair Romero of the working group on consequences applied under the <span class=""highlight"">enforcement</span> branch and the related issue of the legal basis for adoption. He said the group had identified and agreed on a list of short and specific questions for the attention of Ministers. Co-Chair Slade then submitted a Co-ChairsÂ’ Note, based on a similar format, identifying questions on the outstanding issues. He explained that the sections on consequences and legal basis for adoption were mainly based on the outcome of the working group."
enforcement,"On the <span class=""highlight"">enforcement</span> branch consequences, a number of Parties questioned the differences between the Note and the text agreed in the working group. They suggested that the language agreed in the latter be retained. On the legal basis for adoption, delegates discussed whether the COP or the COP/MOP should adopt the decision."
compliance system,"On membership, several Annex I Parties said the proposed questions were drafted in a prejudicial manner, did not distinguish between the two branches, and lacked a clear presentation of the different available options. They said the first option presumed that the composition of the <span class=""highlight"">Compliance Committee</span> be based on UNFCCC existing practice with regard to the bureau, and questioned the precedent-setting nature of this rule in this context. On the second proposed option, some Annex I Parties said membership should be based on the functions and mandate of the branch, rather than solely on the commitments of groups of Parties. A group of developing countries responded that the proposed text constituted a minimalist approach clearly giving the two guiding composition-options. Developing countries and a group of developed countries suggested that voting rules of compliance bodies also be addressed in the questionnaire."
facilitative branch,"On Principles, non-Annex I Parties and several Annex I Parties proposed a question addressing whether Principles should expressly be included in the text. One Annex I Party added a question asking whether, rather than how, the principle of common but <span class=""highlight"">differentiated responsibilities</span> should be reflected in the consequences of the <span class=""highlight"">facilitative branch</span>. Several Annex I Parties suggested that the wording and respective capabilities be added."
funding,"FINANCIAL ISSUES:   This group met in morning and evening sessions. In the morning, delegates considered the proposals on <span class=""highlight"">funding</span> and resource levels in PronkÂ’s text, with many Parties expressing reservations. Most Annex I Parties, opposed by developing countries, supported voluntary rather than mandatory levels of contribution, and opposed any compliance consequences/penalties."
gef|emission|co2,"One developed country added that levels of contributions should be set for countries collectively, not individually, and did not accept the formula for burden sharing, which calculates Annex I PartiesÂ’ financial contributions based on their share of <span class=""highlight"">carbon dioxide</span> <span class=""highlight"">emissions</span> in 1990. Annex I Parties also preferred building on existing institutions, with a focus on the <span class=""highlight"">GEF</span>. These delegates stressed that any new institutions must add value and not duplicate the <span class=""highlight"">GEF</span>Â’s work or mandate."
funding,"One Annex I Party said the discussion on additional <span class=""highlight"">funding</span> was taking place because some Parties wished to move beyond the UNFCCC. He said this should not involve Parties that do not intend to ratify the Protocol. Another group of Annex I Parties said implementation of both the UNFCCC and Protocol requires additional <span class=""highlight"">funding</span>, and insisted on the involvement of all Annex II Parties in this regard."
funding|adaptation fund|eit|economies in transition,"Developing countries stressed the need to separate UNFCCC and Protocol issues. They said President PronkÂ’s adaptation <span class=""highlight"">fund</span> proposal is a Protocol issue. Emphasizing the polluter pays principle, they said existing UNFCCC commitments have not been fully implemented. They expressed reservations over the suggestion of a climate resources committee. A group of countries with <span class=""highlight"">economies in transition</span> (EITs) opposed the textÂ’s proposals for <span class=""highlight"">funding</span> from EITs."
funding,"Parties then considered PronkÂ’s text paragraph by paragraph. In the preamble, several Annex I Parties called for deletion of new and additional <span class=""highlight"">funding</span>. Several EITs proposed refering to Annex II Parties rather than Annex I Parties. Co-Chair Ashe said a Co-ChairsÂ’ text outlining countriesÂ’ positions and the various options would be prepared for the Plenary."
adverse effects/impacts|ldcs|energy,"The group on finance reconvened in the evening to discuss The Hague text on impact of the implementation of response measures. Co-Chair Tsering noted that with the anticipated completion of the texts on Article 3.14 and <span class=""highlight"">LDCs</span>, only matters related to financial matters would be outstanding in the text on <span class=""highlight"">adverse effects</span>. On support for the <span class=""highlight"">development</span> of <span class=""highlight"">energy</span> sources, Parties discussed at length a footnote referring to the Agenda 21 definition of environmentally sound. Non-Annex I Parties, opposed by several developed countries, supported keeping it. One developed country said the term is normal usage in the UN system and the sensitive nature of the issue meant it should be left without the footnote in this text."
ldcs,"Delegates also met throughout the day in various informal groups, making progress on texts on several relevant issues. Text on UNFCCC Article 4.9 (<span class=""highlight"">LDCs</span>) was discussed in a group facilitated by Mamadou Honadia (Burkina Faso), while talks on Protocol Article 3.14 were chaired by Leon Charles (Grenada). Progress was made in both groups, with some brackets being removed. The group on Article 3.14 also considered certain paragraphs in the section on impacts of the implementation of response measures."
technology|technology transfer,"The informal group on <span class=""highlight"">technology</span> transfer agreed on the title Expert Group on <span class=""highlight"">Technology</span> Transfer. Outstanding unresolved issues include the purpose and function of the group, its terms of reference, and its composition. Co-Chair Ashe will prepare a non-paper on this issue to be made available Thursday."
lulucf,"<span class=""highlight"">LULUCF</span>:   Delegates discussed Principles governing <span class=""highlight"">LULUCF</span> activities. It was noted that Principles suggested by the G-77/China and others, and appearing in The Hague text, had been integrated into operative paragraphs of the Pronk text. Many Parties argued that the Principles should be explicit and form a preamble. It was decided that Ministers would be informed that the Principles, as contained in The Hague text, have been widely accepted and should guide their further work."
forest,"In a discussion on the <span class=""highlight"">accounting rules</span> under Article 3.3 contained in PronkÃ¯Â¿Â½s text, two Annex I Parties questioned the absence of reference to the accounting anomaly related to short rotation <span class=""highlight"">forests</span>."
cdm|lulucf|base year,"The EU presented its proposal on <span class=""highlight"">LULUCF</span> activities, which aims at reducing their overall scale by capping Article 3.4 activities and the mechanisms respectively. The proposal does not allow <span class=""highlight"">LULUCF</span> activities in the <span class=""highlight"">CDM</span>, on which several Parties expressed reservations. Some Annex I Parties opposed using a discount rate and capping the mechanisms, which they said already are heavily constrained. A group of EITs supported a practical compromise based on a negotiated relative limit, representing a percentage of <span class=""highlight"">base year</span> <span class=""highlight"">emissions</span>, to Article 3.4 activities. Parties then briefly commented on the Co-ChairsÃ¯Â¿Â½ Summary from the negotiating group to be presented to Plenary."
uncertainties,"With the high-level ministerial meeting starting Thursday, participants have been considering the likely strategies of the key negotiating groups. While there was speculation that those committed to a strong Protocol would need to compromise heavily to keep the treaty alive, some non-governmental participants thought these Parties might take a different, tougher approach to preserve the ProtocolÃ¯Â¿Â½s environmental integrity and shame others into joining. However, even some veterans to the process admitted <span class=""highlight"">uncertainty</span> on what the most effective strategy might be."
cdm projects|nuclear|cdm,"Meanwhile, several observers were detecting further hardening of positions among groups, pointing to the resurrection of issues such as <span class=""highlight"">nuclear</span> <span class=""highlight"">projects in the CDM, that many thought had been resolved in The Hague. The more optimistic commentators dismissed this as merely posturing aimed at creating greater negotiating capital prior to the high-level talks. Self-titled realists are suggesting some Parties may be holding off on playing their cards until COP-7.</span>"
gef|funding|adverse effects/impacts|economies in transition|eit|technology transfer|technology,"Finance:   Co-Chair Ashe reported on the status of the work on capacity building, <span class=""highlight"">technology</span> transfer, guidance to the <span class=""highlight"">GEF</span>, and <span class=""highlight"">funding</span> issues. He highlighted bracket-free draft decisions on capacity building in developing countries and in countries with <span class=""highlight"">economies in transition</span>. On guidance to the <span class=""highlight"">GEF</span>, he indicated that the draft decision reflected agreement on all outstanding matters. He said agreement had not been reached on <span class=""highlight"">funding</span> issues, but an informal paper on <span class=""highlight"">funding</span> and resource levels had been drafted. Co- Chair Kranjc said discussions on UNFCCC Article 4.8 and 4.9 and Protocol Article 3.14 (<span class=""highlight"">adverse effects</span>) had not been completed. He indicated that an informal paper had been prepared outlining the agreed and disputed elements of the text. Both Co-Chairs indicated that consultations on the remaining unresolved issues would continue."

On definitions, he said these could still be affected by the outcome of political decisions. On Principles, he suggested the Ministers use the G-77/China proposal as a basis for their work. On <span class=""highlight"">accounting rules</span> for activities eligible under Protocol Article 3.3 (<span class=""highlight"">afforestation</span>, <span class=""highlight"">reforestation</span> and <span class=""highlight"">deforestation</span>) and Article 3.4 (<span class=""highlight"">additional activities</span>), he said particular issues under consideration related to slow and fast-growing <span class=""highlight"">forests</span>. Co-Chair Gwage then presented the key political issues, which include: the crediting of Article 3.4 activities during the first commitment period and the scope of <span class=""highlight"">LULUCF</span> activities under the <span class=""highlight"">CDM</span>. He outlined the many options available to resolve these issues. Co-Chair Dovland emphasized the need to resolve Article 3.4 issues in order to move forward."
equitable geographic distribution|cdm|additionality|nuclear|supplementarity|cdm projects|distribution of cdm projects,"Mechanisms:   Co-Chair Estrada presented a list of technical and political issues that need to be resolved. Political issues include: <span class=""highlight"">equity</span>; <span class=""highlight"">supplementarity</span>; <span class=""highlight"">nuclear</span>; the nature of a supervisory committee; the composition of the Executive Board; the share of proceeds for adaptation; the reserve level for the commitment period for <span class=""highlight"">emissions</span> trading; compliance agreement as an eligibility criterion; unilateral <span class=""highlight"">CDM</span>; <span class=""highlight"">sinks</span> in the <span class=""highlight"">CDM</span>; Protocol Article 4 (joint fulfillment); special needs of developing country Parties in the context of the <span class=""highlight"">CDM</span>; financial <span class=""highlight"">additionality</span>; and <span class=""highlight"">equitable geographic distribution</span> of <span class=""highlight"">CDM</span> projects."
cdm|additionality|supplementarity|cdm projects|distribution of cdm projects|vulnerable,"On technical issues, Co-Chair Estrada noted the good progress of the two relevant working groups. The G-77/CHINA stressed the importance of <span class=""highlight"">equity</span>, environmental integrity, adaptation, <span class=""highlight"">supplementarity</span>, <span class=""highlight"">additionality</span> and distribution of <span class=""highlight"">CDM</span> projects. AUSTRALIA and JAPAN said the wording in the mechanisms text describing the compliance agreement as an eligibility criterion implied that such an agreement already existed. SAUDI ARABIA suggested referring expressly to developing country Parties particularly <span class=""highlight"">vulnerable</span> to impacts of <span class=""highlight"">adverse effects</span>. JAPAN proposed that the reference to <span class=""highlight"">ODA</span> as meeting financial obligations, should be considered under financial issues rather than mechanisms."
enforcement|facilitative branch,"Compliance:   Co-Chair Slade said the compliance report identified six outstanding issues. He suggested that the resolution of key political issues Â– the consequences to be applied by the branches and the composition of those branches Â– be given priority. On the former issue, he highlighted the options identified in the report on the rate to be applied by the <span class=""highlight"">enforcement</span> branch, and the differentiation between Annex I and non-Annex I Parties in the consequences to be applied by the <span class=""highlight"">facilitative branch</span>."
buenos aires programme of work|investment,"UNFCCC Executive Secretary Michael Zammit Cutajar recalled the aims of the <span class=""highlight"">Buenos Aires Plan of Action</span> (BAPA), and highlighted the challenges and needs of developing countries in responding to climate change. Noting progress in talks during the past few days, he said it would be a waste to abandon the <span class=""highlight"">investment</span> of several years of negotiations."
agriculture|precipitation|intergovernmental panel on climate change|sea level rise|emissions scenarios|greenhouse gas emissions|gas|co2|emission,"Robert Watson, Chair of the <span class=""highlight"">Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change</span>, stated that all the <span class=""highlight"">scenarios</span> considered for the next century predict an ongoing increase in <span class=""highlight"">carbon dioxide</span> levels, more <span class=""highlight"">extreme weather events</span>, temperature increases, changes in <span class=""highlight"">precipitation</span>, <span class=""highlight"">sea level</span> rise, and impacts on <span class=""highlight"">agricultural</span> productivity. He noted that cost-effective technologies exist to target <span class=""highlight"">greenhouse gas emissions. He said the costs of addressing climate change domestically are estimated at 0.2-2 percent of GDP, falling even lower if international cooperation occurs.</span>"
funding|adverse effects/impacts|lulucf|flexibility|binding commitments|emissions trading,"A number of Parties then made general statements. IRAN, for the G-77/CHINA, expressed concern with the unilateral approach of the US, and emphasized: preference for three separate decisions on mechanisms; the need to address <span class=""highlight"">adverse effects</span>; support for legally <span class=""highlight"">binding consequences</span> of non-compliance; and the need for further negotiations on <span class=""highlight"">LULUCF</span>. BELGIUM, for the EU, said it is ready for compromises with all Parties to reach agreement on a balanced package that respects: environmental integrity; <span class=""highlight"">equity</span> and <span class=""highlight"">solidarity</span> with developing countries; and economic efficiency and <span class=""highlight"">flexibility</span> in meeting the agreed targets. SAMOA, for AOSIS, emphasized the need for additional <span class=""highlight"">funds</span> to undertake adaptation. The CZECH REPUBLIC, for CG-11, expressed concern with the Pronk text on financial obligations for Parties included in Annex I and not included in Annex II, and with proposals for a levy on <span class=""highlight"">joint implementation</span> and <span class=""highlight"">emissions</span> trading. MOROCCO expressed his hope that COP-7 would provide renewed impetus ahead of the Johannesburg 2002 Summit."
agriculture|uncertainties|forest|sink|compliance system,"AUSTRALIA stated that <span class=""highlight"">uncertainty</span> regarding future involvement of certain states should not stop key issues from being addressed, and emphasized: the non-discriminatory rules on <span class=""highlight"">sinks</span>; a <span class=""highlight"">compliance system</span> that assists Parties rather than punishes non-compliance; and the launch of dialogue on action with developing countries. CANADA underlined the importance of efficient and accessible <span class=""highlight"">market mechanisms</span>, the role of <span class=""highlight"">forests</span> and <span class=""highlight"">agriculture</span>, and the need to encourage developing country action."
nuclear|domestic action|sink|compliance system,"SWITZERLAND, for the ENVIRONMENTAL INTEGRITY GROUP, said <span class=""highlight"">sinks</span> should be of a limited scale, mechanisms should complement <span class=""highlight"">domestic action</span>, and there should be a strong <span class=""highlight"">compliance regime</span> with legally <span class=""highlight"">binding consequences</span>. CHINA noted a document outlining its achievements to address climate change. The RUSSIAN FEDERATION emphasized the need for simplicity in the mechanisms, including <span class=""highlight"">sinks</span> and <span class=""highlight"">nuclear</span>, and expressed concern with proposals on financial issues."
lulucf|compliance system,"On mechanisms, Co-Chair Estrada identified the major issues requiring a political decision. Co-Chair Dovland highlighted two key questions related to <span class=""highlight"">LULUCF</span> Ã¯Â¿Â½ whether there should be credits for activities under Article 3.4 during the first commitment period, and whether there should be credits for <span class=""highlight"">LULUCF</span> activities under the project-based mechanisms. In presenting the report of the <span class=""highlight"">compliance group</span>, Co-Chair Slade outlined the available options relating to the consequences and the composition of the branches. He said the resolution of both matters would pave the way to agreement on other issues. On financial issues, Co-Chairs Ashe and Kranjc presented an overview of the questions and options to be addressed by Ministers."
lulucf|forestry|land use|land-use change,"Delegates to the resumed COP-6 met in a morning Plenary to address organizational matters. In the afternoon, Ministers and other high-level officials began substantive negotiations behind closed doors, focusing on financial issues, the mechanisms and <span class=""highlight"">land use</span>, <span class=""highlight"">land-use</span> change and <span class=""highlight"">forestry</span> (<span class=""highlight"">LULUCF</span>). Late in the evening, President Pronk convened a brief Plenary session to update participants on progress."
adverse effects/impacts|funding|lulucf|technology|technology transfer,"The main negotiating group of ministers and other high-level officials began their work early afternoon, discussing the options for key issues set out under the Note by the Co-Chairs of the negotiating groups. This document sets out the key issues under four sections: <span class=""highlight"">funding</span>, <span class=""highlight"">technology</span> transfer and <span class=""highlight"">adverse effects</span>; mechanisms; <span class=""highlight"">LULUCF</span>; and compliance. Delegates discussed elements of the first three sections, and will take up compliance issues on Saturday morning."
funding|sccf|gef|special climate change fund,"FINANCE:   Participants began by discussing the finance section of the Co- ChairsÂ’ Note. On <span class=""highlight"">funding</span> and resource levels, delegates discussed the questions addressing President PronkÂ’s proposed Adaptation and Special Climate Change <span class=""highlight"">funds</span>. Options include whether contributions to the <span class=""highlight"">funds</span> should be voluntary or mandatory and who should contribute; whether non-payment should have consequences; and whether the <span class=""highlight"">GEF</span> should establish and manage the Special Climate Change <span class=""highlight"">fund</span>. Questions on the Special Climate Change <span class=""highlight"">fund</span> also address: whether activities related to <span class=""highlight"">economic diversification</span> and measures for mitigation should be included, and whether non-Annex I Parties would be required to implement national strategies for mitigation and sequestration as a condition for accessing new and additional <span class=""highlight"">funding</span> from the <span class=""highlight"">fund</span>."
technology|technology transfer,"General agreement was achieved on some aspects, and a consultation group facilitated by Philippe Roch (Switzerland) was convened to consider the questions further. This consultation group will report back to the main negotiating group tomorrow. Remaining issues to be discussed include <span class=""highlight"">technology</span> transfer and <span class=""highlight"">adverse effects</span>."
supplementarity|domestic action|compliance system|enforcement|facilitative branch,"On the issue of <span class=""highlight"">supplementarity</span>, delegates considered four options: no elaboration; Annex I Parties to meet commitments primarily through <span class=""highlight"">domestic action</span> since 1990, with each PartyÂ’s use of the mechanisms not exceeding 9% of its assigned amount; Annex I Parties to meet commitments primarily through <span class=""highlight"">domestic action</span>, with use of the mechanisms not exceeding reductions achieved through <span class=""highlight"">domestic actions</span> as reported in national communications, and as assessed by the <span class=""highlight"">enforcement</span> branch of the <span class=""highlight"">compliance committee</span>; or chiefly through <span class=""highlight"">domestic action</span>, with implementation and/or elaboration of <span class=""highlight"">policies and measures</span>, the provision of relevant information, and with the <span class=""highlight"">facilitative branch</span> of the <span class=""highlight"">compliance committee</span> addressing relevant questions of implementation."
cer|cers|nuclear,"On whether <span class=""highlight"">emission</span> reduction units (ERUs) and <span class=""highlight"">certified emission reductions</span> (<span class=""highlight"">CERs</span>) can be generated by <span class=""highlight"">nuclear</span> power projects, the options are no mention of <span class=""highlight"">nuclear</span>, or that Annex I Parties refrain from using <span class=""highlight"">nuclear</span>. Regarding the establishment of a supervisory committee for verification of ERUs, the options are: no committee, with verification being performed by teams constituted by the Secretariat; or a committee, the composition of which has to be agreed separately."
cdm projects|distribution of cdm projects|equitable geographic distribution|cdm|additionality,"The remaining issues to be discussed are: the application and level of share of proceeds; the commitment period reserve level; the compliance agreement as an eligibility requirement; the unilateral <span class=""highlight"">CDM</span>; Article 4 (joint fulfillment); special needs of developing country parties; financial <span class=""highlight"">additionality</span>; and <span class=""highlight"">equitable geographic distribution</span> of <span class=""highlight"">CDM</span> projects."
cdm|additionality|baselines|agriculture|additional activities|forest management|forest|lulucf,"<span class=""highlight"">LULUCF</span>:   Delegates began discussing this issue Friday evening. The key questions they addressed related to whether or not there should be credits under Protocol Article 3.4 (<span class=""highlight"">additional activities</span>) during the first commitment period. If crediting is allowed, a decision needs to be made on the extent of crediting for <span class=""highlight"">forest</span> management and <span class=""highlight"">agricultural</span> activities (cropland management, grazing land management, and revegetation). Options for limiting credits from <span class=""highlight"">forest</span> management include: the use of individual Party negotiated caps; demonstrated <span class=""highlight"">additionality</span> of activities since 1990 against a <span class=""highlight"">baseline</span> using approved methodologies as well as negotiated caps; an overall cap divided between Parties; and a formula-based approach with a discount and a cap. During discussions, delegates focused on options for including <span class=""highlight"">forest</span> management, with some indication of compromise emerging in favor of the option of an overall cap divided among Parties. Remaining issues to be discussed are the inclusion of <span class=""highlight"">LULUCF</span> activities under the Protocol project-based mechanisms, <span class=""highlight"">joint implementation</span> and the <span class=""highlight"">CDM</span>."
funding|sccf|special climate change fund|adaptation fund,"Shortly after midnight Friday night, President Pronk reported back to participants, noting that some good work had been done during the dayÂ’s ministerial negotiations. He said discussions on the finance text were fruitful on a number of issues. There was consensus on the need for resources for adaptation and capacity building. He noted support for the proposed Adaptation <span class=""highlight"">fund</span> and a Special Climate Change <span class=""highlight"">fund</span>. However there were diverging views on whether the <span class=""highlight"">funding</span> related to the UNFCCC or Protocol, although a compromise had been suggested. He noted discussion on the option of sharing financial contributions on the basis of criteria to be determined. However, many questions remained unanswered, with negotiations set to continue Saturday in the consultation group."
nuclear|supplementarity,"Regarding discussions on the mechanisms, he said these had not yet reached the fruitful stage. However, he noted lengthy discussions on several issues, including <span class=""highlight"">equity</span>, <span class=""highlight"">supplementarity</span> and <span class=""highlight"">nuclear</span>. He said Minister Pete Hodgson of New Zealand would convene further talks on this issue."
lulucf,"On <span class=""highlight"">LULUCF</span>, he said negotiators had focused on Article 3.4, and that there had been movement. He noted agreement on the need for a set of common principles and environmental credibility and predictability. He said Ambassador Estrada of Argentina would convene discussions on <span class=""highlight"">LULUCF</span>, and Minister Valli Moosa of South Africa would facilitate the group on compliance."
cdm|additionality|baselines|cdm projects|impact assessments|cers|co2|emission|energy efficiency|energy|renewable energy,"The informal drafting group on <span class=""highlight"">CDM</span> technical issues, chaired by Jose Domingos Gonzales Miguez (Brazil), completed its discussions Friday. The group was established on Wednesday, 18 July, to agree text on the following issues: <span class=""highlight"">baselines</span> and <span class=""highlight"">additionality</span>; small-scale <span class=""highlight"">CDM</span> project activities; environmental <span class=""highlight"">impact assessments</span>; public participation; review by the executive board; and transaction of <span class=""highlight"">CERs</span>. Text was agreed on the issues on the basis that once a decision on the inclusion of <span class=""highlight"">sinks</span> in the <span class=""highlight"">CDM</span> has been taken, this would need to be revisited. On small scale <span class=""highlight"">CDM</span> project activities, agreement has not been reached on the scales relating to renewable <span class=""highlight"">energy</span> project activities, <span class=""highlight"">energy</span> efficiency improvement project activities, or other project activities that both reduce anthropogenic <span class=""highlight"">emissions</span> by sources and that directly emit less than a certain amount of kilo tons of <span class=""highlight"">carbon dioxide</span> equivalent annually. A request has been made that experts from Parties may put forward some examples of project activities to the Secretariat that illustrate the quoted figures. The full text on all the issues will be revisited next week when negotiations resume at the diplomatic level."
buenos aires programme of work,"Delegates to the resumed COP-6 met throughout the weekend and into Monday morning in high-level negotiations. Following extensive talks, Ministers and other senior officials met in a Plenary session late Monday morning, where they agreed to a proposed draft decision produced by President Pronk. The decision sets out a political text outlining core elements for the implementation of the <span class=""highlight"">Buenos Aires Plan of Action</span> (BAPA)."
lulucf,"SATURDAY - FIRST MEETING:   In a mid-afternoon meeting of the PresidentÂ’s Group Â– a single, main plenary of Ministers and other senior officials Â– President Pronk updated participants on progress in consultations held earlier Saturday on the issues of finance, mechanisms, <span class=""highlight"">LULUCF</span> and compliance."
funding,"Secretary of State Philippe Roch (Switzerland) reported on the consultations on finance. He emphasized the diverse positions on fundamental aspects of <span class=""highlight"">funding</span> and reported possible progress on four elements: the necessity to clearly separate between the implementation of the UNFCCC and the Protocol in order to allow those Parties not wishing to ratify the Protocol to continue to participate in mitigation work under the UNFCCC; the need for additional <span class=""highlight"">funding</span> for the implementation of the UNFCCC and the Protocol; the need for <span class=""highlight"">funding</span> to be predictable; and the need to quantify the <span class=""highlight"">funding</span>. He explained that this last element constituted the weakest result of his consultations."
supplementarity|nuclear|domestic action|compliance system|facilitative branch,"Minister Peter Hodgson (New Zealand) reported on his consultations on the mechanisms. He said that although no explicit agreement had been reached, progress on some matters had been made, in particular with the introduction of new text that might fly. On <span class=""highlight"">supplementarity</span>, he said the EU had moved big distances. He reported that he had suggested text that: includes a reference to significant as an elaboration of the term supplemental; requests Annex I Parties to provide relevant information in relation to such <span class=""highlight"">domestic action</span>; and provides that the <span class=""highlight"">facilitative branch</span> of the <span class=""highlight"">Compliance Committee</span> address questions of implementation on this issue. On <span class=""highlight"">nuclear</span>, he suggested an addition to the language in the Pronk text giving an assessment role to the host country in terms of the sustainability of the project. On the Supervisory Committee, Minister Hodgson said the ball is in the court of the Russian Federation and Ukraine."
lulucf,"On <span class=""highlight"">LULUCF</span>, Ambassador Raul Estrada (Argentina) said consultations had focused on individual and collective caps. He emphasized that the principal problem was the Big Absent of the negotiations, and that efforts had been made to protect this absent countryÂ’s interests to facilitate its joining the Protocol at a later stage."
binding commitments|compliance system,"Minister Valli Moosa (South Africa) reported on the consultations on compliance. He said that given the <span class=""highlight"">legally binding</span> nature of the Protocol, its <span class=""highlight"">compliance mechanism</span> must go well beyond a mere gentlemenÂ’s agreement. He suggested a stepped approach for the <span class=""highlight"">compliance system</span> with an emphasis on facilitation. The first step would be an early warning system through the review teams setting a process of facilitation to assist Parties in cases where there might be non-compliance. During the compliance period itself, legally <span class=""highlight"">binding consequences</span> would need to ensure environmental restoration rather than punish the Party concerned. He also indicated the need for certainty for <span class=""highlight"">market mechanisms</span>."
policies and measures|adverse effects/impacts|advers effect policy|technology transfer|technology,"President Pronk then reported on his consultations on <span class=""highlight"">technology</span> transfer. He said the name of the body had been agreed upon and that there was <span class=""highlight"">flexibility</span> in the air with regard to its composition. On <span class=""highlight"">adverse effects</span> of <span class=""highlight"">policies and measures</span>, he suggested, _inter alia_, a move towards a global cost-effective approach to minimize costs for all countries. He concluded the session by saying that, following the request from the G-77/China and other Parties, he would prepare a proposal to be tabled later that day."

On <span class=""highlight"">LULUCF</span>, the text proposes including activities under Protocol Article 3.4 (<span class=""highlight"">additional activities</span>) during the first commitment period, with individual Party caps on credits from <span class=""highlight"">forest</span> management. On finance, a political declaration inviting <span class=""highlight"">funding</span> from Annex II Parties. Key proposals on the mechanisms include: <span class=""highlight"">afforestation</span> and <span class=""highlight"">reforestation</span> <span class=""highlight"">projects in the CDM during the first commitment period; Annex I Parties refraining from using nuclear in the CDM and JI; domestic action constituting a significant element of Annex I PartiesÂ’ efforts to meet commitments; and a provision on financial additionality.

He concluded by saying he would continue to consult with delegates, including separately with individual Umbrella Group members. He hoped to come forward with a specific proposal aimed at securing a deal by Sunday evening."
compliance system|enforcement,"He introduced the draft decision resulting from negotiations, which is contained in two informal papers entitled core elements for the implementation of the BAPA. The first, dated 21 July, was distributed Saturday night (see PronkÂ’s core elements proposal on page one). The second, dated 23 July, contains the revised text on compliance. The compliance text was amended in three key areas: consequences to be applied by the <span class=""highlight"">enforcement</span> branch shall aim at ensuring environmental integrity rather than reparation of damage to the environment; the stipulation that payments be made to repair damage to the environment is deleted; and COP-6 adopts the <span class=""highlight"">compliance regime</span> and recommends to COP/MOP-1 the adoption, in terms of Article 18 (compliance), of procedures and mechanisms relating to compliance."
funding,"The EU said the agreement was historic and, with the ENVIRONMENTAL INTEGRITY GROUP, stressed that it was very positive for the international community. He said the door had been left open for a country that considers that the Protocol is not the best tool to address climate change, to join at a later stage. He then read the text of a Political Declaration submitted by the EU, Canada, Iceland, Norway, New Zealand and Switzerland on <span class=""highlight"">funding</span> to developing countries, which includes an engagement to provide an annual contribution of US$ 410 million by 2005."

CHINA thanked the EU and others for their Political Declaration and said the agreement had demonstrated that, in times of crisis, the international community continues to move in the right direction. JAPAN expressed pleasure in joining the consensus that constitutes a vital step towards realizing the <span class=""highlight"">entry into force</span> of the Protocol by 2002. She added that a global effort is needed to achieve the ProtocolÃ¯Â¿Â½s objectives. CG-11 said individual members promised to do their best to engage the Protocol ratification process and hoped the skeptical country would join the global endeavor."

She added that the fact that the US did not seek to block consensus did not change her countryÃ¯Â¿Â½s view that the Protocol is not sound policy. The RUSSIAN FEDERATION said that although his country is not currently able to join in <span class=""highlight"">financial assistance</span> to developing countries, he thinks it will be able to do so sometime in the future. SAUDI ARABIA said that, in spite of some concerns, it had agreed to join the consensus. The meeting closed at 2:05 pm."
funding,"A profound sense of relief swept the corridors late Monday morning as it finally emerged that Ministers and other high-level officials had achieved a result in Bonn on key political issues after marathon talks. While many bleary-eyed observers were noting that this text involved many compromises, especially on the part of the EU and the G-77/China, most seemed elated that an agreement had been reached, even if the general perception was that it was not as strong as it could have been. Some participants noted that, with the US no longer in the Protocol picture, the remaining Umbrella Group members had held all the cards coming into these talks, meaning that a result generally favoring their positions on key issues such as <span class=""highlight"">sinks</span>, compliance and <span class=""highlight"">funding</span> was always likely if a deal was to be struck at all. Several participants also suggested that this outcome was a victory for multilateralism."

The EU noted progress in addressing the technical basis of the proposal, but identified several outstanding issues. CHINA, supported by BRAZIL, SAUDI ARABIA and INDIA, warned that the work should not go beyond the COPÂ’s mandate.

He proposed that the remaining work be conducted in negotiating groups on finance, mechanisms, <span class=""highlight"">LULUCF</span>, compliance and Protocol Articles 5 (methodological issues), 7 (communication of information) and 8 (review of information). SAUDI ARABIA, for the G-77/CHINA, said that the work on Articles 5, 7 and 8 should start only after the adoption of the decisions on the <span class=""highlight"">Buenos Aires Plan of Action</span>. President Pronk said there would be daily meetings with the negotiating groupsÃ¯Â¿Â½ Chairs to provide clarity on the timing and structure of the remainder of the session.

Behind the scenes, concern surfaced over so-called technical and editorial changes made overnight Monday to the latest version of the decision, with some participants suggesting that several alterations had substantive/political implications. In the section on mechanisms, the removal of a reference to the principles guiding <span class=""highlight"">afforestation</span> and <span class=""highlight"">reforestation</span> <span class=""highlight"">projects under the CDM reportedly made some delegates shudder. There was also controversy in this section over new language on the mechanismsÃ¯Â¿Â½ eligibility requirement related to compliance.

forest|forest management,"The text of this decision is identical to that contained in the proposal presented to the PresidentÂ’s Group on Saturday 21 July at 11:00 pm, incorporating the text on procedures and mechanisms relating to compliance that had been presented for adoption during the High-Level Plenary on Monday 23 July. President Pronk noted that there remain a number of inconsistencies to be addressed, which are listed in two documents: the first (FCCC/CP/2001/ CRP.9) presents an inventory of editorial and technical amendments as identified by the Secretariat, while the second (FCCC/CP/ 2001/CRP.10) is a proposal by the Russian Federation to include a footnote stating that the values allocated to the Russian Federation for <span class=""highlight"">forest</span> management are considered as preliminary figures."

He proposed that work commence with the first four groups. AUSTRALIA, CANADA and NEW ZEALAND underlined the importance of Articles 5, 7, and 8, and urged that this be addressed as soon as possible. Co-Chair Raul Estrada of the mechanisms negotiating group noted that <span class=""highlight"">LULUCF</span> in the mechanisms would be addressed in the <span class=""highlight"">LULUCF</span> group, and that issues on the registries, which also affect Articles 5, 7 and 8, would be addressed in the mechanisms group. CANADA expressed concern with registries being extracted from the package on Articles 5, 7 and 8. President Pronk said these concerns will be addressed by the Bureau Thursday."

An Annex I Party highlighted that the newly-adopted political decision on the implementation of the BAPA contains sections that overlap with the informal paper, and stressed that the decision was the definitive document. Parties considered a proposal by one delegation on the implementation of activities addressing <span class=""highlight"">adverse effects</span> of climate change to distinguish between activities supported by the <span class=""highlight"">GEF</span> and other bilateral and multilateral sources, and activities supported by the Special Climate Change <span class=""highlight"">fund</span>, the Adaptation <span class=""highlight"">fund</span>, and other bilateral and multilateral sources. Several Annex I Parties noted that the proposal was aimed at providing clear guidance. Developing countries said re-drafting the section would prove complicated and time-consuming. Co-Chair Andrej Kranjc suggested that a small drafting group be convened. This group met immediately upon closure of the meeting of the negotiating group in order to address the division of the activities into those supported by the <span class=""highlight"">GEF</span> and those supported by the Adaptation <span class=""highlight"">fund</span> and Special Climate Change <span class=""highlight"">fund</span>."

Murray Ward (New Zealand), Chair of the informal sub-group on mechanismsÂ’ eligibility and the verification procedures for track two of the <span class=""highlight"">joint implementation</span> projects, noted that some disagreement remains, in particular on verification procedures. Chair of the informal drafting sub-group on <span class=""highlight"">CDM</span> technical issues, Jose Domingos Gonzales Miguez (Brazil), reported that consensus had been achieved on: <span class=""highlight"">baselines</span> and <span class=""highlight"">additionality</span>; small-scale <span class=""highlight"">CDM</span> project activities; environmental <span class=""highlight"">impact assessments</span>; public participation; and review by the Executive Board.

A number of Parties expressed concern with agreeing text on the basis of overhead slides only, and requested printed copies of the integrated text. Noting these concerns, the Co-Chairs presented the text identifying the source of the various paragraphs. The meeting was then adjourned to allow delegates to continue working in the informal sub- groups."
enforcement|facilitative branch,"Following the resumption of the meeting, delegates gave their initial reactions to the non-paper. Developing countries and many developed countries welcomed it as providing a good basis for the groupÂ’s further work. One Annex I Party expressed concern about the reflection, in the non-paper, of parts of the political decision not included in the compliance section. With several other Annex I Parties, she also questioned the accurate reflection of the paragraph of this decision pertaining to the adoption of procedures and mechanisms relating to compliance. A group of Annex I Parties expressed some unease over the modifications relating to the <span class=""highlight"">facilitative branch</span>, its relation to the <span class=""highlight"">enforcement</span> branch and the appeal procedure. This group also reminded participants of the mandate given by the Ministers to complete their work by the end of COP-6. Closing the meeting, Co-Chair Slade invited those delegates in a position to do so, to provide, by midday Thursday, drafting suggestions on how the political decision text could be reflected in the non- paper."

He stressed that the decisions would reflect the political decision taken by Ministers on Monday, 23 July, as well as the package of documents previously discussed in the negotiating group. He suggested a smaller group be convened to carry out the drafting work, based on a new draft prepared by the Co-Chairs. Many Parties endorsed this approach. Andreas Fischlin (Switzerland) and Halldor Thorgeirsson (Iceland) were appointed as Co-Chairs of the drafting group. The Secretariat distributed the ChairsÂ’ draft decisions concerning <span class=""highlight"">LULUCF</span>, containing language directly from the political decision and additional legal text. The draft decisions comprise: a COP-6 decision; a COP/MOP-1 decision; an annex including definitions, modalities, rules and guidelines related to <span class=""highlight"">LULUCF</span> under the Protocol; and an appendix including the maximum amount of Mt C/year that Annex I Parties may receive credits for during the first commitment period as a result of <span class=""highlight"">forest</span> management under Protocol Article 3.4 (<span class=""highlight"">additional activities</span>) and <span class=""highlight"">LULUCF</span> activities under <span class=""highlight"">joint implementation</span>. The drafting group met late evening to work on the document, and continued consultations into the night."

Participants engaged in a question-and-answer session on various aspects of the programme budget, including: staffing requirements; geographic representation of staff; the overall <span class=""highlight"">funding</span> increase being proposed; and the impact of decisions by the COP on the work programme. Delegates also discussed spending priorities, with developing countries highlighting <span class=""highlight"">technology</span> transfer as one of the key areas."
forest|forest management,"Participants spent many nervous hours Wednesday morning and afternoon as disagreements over the political decision agreed on Monday sent negotiators scrambling to patch up their differences. Concerns about the substantive/political implications of some of the technical and editorial changes made to the political decision apparently resulted in some differences of views over which version to put to the Plenary for formal adoption. Concerns also related to the level of the Russian FederationÃ¯Â¿Â½s allocated cap on <span class=""highlight"">forest</span> management, with that country formally proposing that the figures it had allocated were preliminary. In addition, there were also questions about the best way to proceed organizationally with COP-6 Part II during its remaining days. However, these issues appeared resolved by late afternoon, when the Plenary was finally able to formally adopt the political decision and set out its organization of work."
lulucf|forestry|land use|land-use change,"Delegates to the resumed COP-6 met throughout the day to continue working on texts for draft decisions and conclusions to be considered by the COP. Participants convened in negotiating groups on finance, compliance, mechanisms, and <span class=""highlight"">land use</span>, <span class=""highlight"">land-use</span> change and <span class=""highlight"">forestry</span> (<span class=""highlight"">LULUCF</span>), as well as in several sub-groups and a number of informal consultations."
cdm|lulucf,"MECHANISMS:   This group met in the morning to consider the Co-ChairsÂ’ non- paper, which is a consolidation of the political decision, The Hague text, the Pronk text, and text agreed in the technical working groups. Co-Chair Chow noted that two technical working groups were meeting on: mechanisms eligibility and verification procedures of <span class=""highlight"">joint implementation</span> (<span class=""highlight"">JI</span>) track two projects, and the Article 6 (<span class=""highlight"">JI</span>) project cycle; and the <span class=""highlight"">CDM</span>. Participants discussed the interface with the <span class=""highlight"">LULUCF</span> negotiating group, noting that this group would be responsible for substantive issues on <span class=""highlight"">LULUCF</span> activities in the mechanisms. A group of Annex I Parties stressed the need to focus also on Article 17 (<span class=""highlight"">emissions</span> trading). The morning meeting was adjourned, with work continuing in the technical working groups."
cdm|lulucf,"The negotiating group reconvened in the evening and received feedback from the technical working groups. Chair Miguez of the <span class=""highlight"">CDM</span> group noted the state of progress on new methodologies, monitoring, registries, and the approval of host parties, on which disagreement remained. Chair Ward of the second technical working group noted that delegates had not fully addressed the composition of the supervisory committee or the <span class=""highlight"">JI</span> appendices. He said issues relating to eligibility and the treatment of <span class=""highlight"">LULUCF</span>, and issues linked to Articles 5 (methodological issues), 7 (communication of information) and 8 (review of information), would need to be addressed at COP-7. A group of Annex I Parties requested that their text on the <span class=""highlight"">JI</span> appendices be included in the report. Co-Chair Estrada said this text should be submitted separately."

The draft decisions were agreed in the evening."
binding commitments,"COMPLIANCE:   During a morning meeting, Co-Chair Slade suggested that delegates proceed through the Co-ChairsÂ’ non-paper on procedures and mechanisms on compliance under the Protocol. On the draft COP decision, delegates discussed legal and political issues related to the paragraph whereby the COP adopts the procedures and mechanisms on compliance annexed thereto. Several Annex I Parties suggested deleting this paragraph, arguing that the mandate given by Ministers had already been fulfilled through the adoption of the political decision on Wednesday, 25 July, and that the COP had no legal authority to adopt procedures and mechanisms relating to compliance under the Protocol. They added that although further work was required on this issue, it only had to be conducted in time for a COP/MOP-1 decision. They also suggested that, according to the political decision, the compliance procedures and mechanisms to be elaborated would not be <span class=""highlight"">legally binding</span>. Other Annex I Parties and developing countries said the political decision instructs delegates to negotiate and adopt, during the second week of COP-6 Part II, a balanced package of further decisions, and that UNFCCC Article 7.2. (functions of the COP) provides the legal basis for the adoption of such a decision on compliance procedures and mechanisms. They added that the political decision leaves open the issue of whether the compliance procedures and mechanisms, to be adopted by COP/MOP-1, will be <span class=""highlight"">legally binding</span> or not."
compliance system|expert review,"Going through the remainder of the non-paper, delegates made a number of drafting and substantial suggestions. On the role of the COP/MOP, proposals were made, _inter alia,_ on: whether the <span class=""highlight"">Compliance Committee</span> would follow, consider or apply the COPÂ’s general policy guidance; whether a panel established by the COP/MOP would consider the reports of <span class=""highlight"">expert review</span> teams; and whether the COP/MOP would adopt or merely consider the report of the <span class=""highlight"">Compliance Committee</span>."
enforcement|facilitative branch,"On elements regarding the <span class=""highlight"">facilitative branch</span>, discussions related to, _inter alia_: the scope of the Protocol provisions falling within the mandate of the <span class=""highlight"">facilitative branch</span>; how the <span class=""highlight"">facilitative branch</span> would consider issues relating to Article 3.14 (<span class=""highlight"">adverse effects</span>); and whether there should be provision for EITs to receive financial and technical assistance. On issues with regard to the <span class=""highlight"">enforcement</span> branch, delegates considered, _inter alia_: whether consequences other than the suspension of the eligibility to use the mechanisms may be applied in case of non-compliance with Articles 5.1 (national systems) 5.2 (adjustments), 7.1 (inventories) and 7.4 (guidelines for the communication of information); whether a Party may submit questions of implementation with regard to another Party; whether mechanismsÂ’ eligibility requirements only apply to Annex I Parties; what would be the status of the <span class=""highlight"">enforcement</span> branch decision pending the decision on appeal; whether references to shall should be replaced with should; whether the consequences in case of non-compliance with Article 3.1(assigned amounts) will apply individually to each country under Article 4 (joint fulfillment); and whether the suspension of the eligibility to make transfers also applies to Article 6 (<span class=""highlight"">JI</span>)."
compliance system,"On completing the reading of the non-paper, Co-Chair Slade emphasized the fundamental disagreements among Parties and suggested that a small group convene to attempt to resolve them. Developing countries and many Annex I Parties expressed doubts about the possible positive outcome of such a group and suggested the intervention of President Pronk on the way forward, while several Annex I Parties said they were willing to continue their work. One developing country delegate said it was rare to see delegates trying to unravel an agreement reached at the highest level. He expressed his deep disappointment and frustration as well as his concern about the outcome of COP-6 Part II. A group of Annex I Parties said its understanding of the political deal was that in return for not having a separate <span class=""highlight"">legally binding</span> <span class=""highlight"">compliance regime</span> now, a further elaborated text on compliance would be adopted by the end of this session. Concluding the meeting, Co-Chair Slade said he would report to President Pronk and the Bureau."
cdm|lulucf|forest management|forest,"<span class=""highlight"">LULUCF</span>:   The negotiating group met in afternoon and evening sessions, with a smaller drafting group convening throughout the day. In the afternoon session, drafting group co-facilitators Thorgeirsson and Fischlin reported on progress. They said only sections where the political decision had been ambiguous required further consultation, and identified as such the question of whether the draft decision refers to eligibility of <span class=""highlight"">LULUCF</span> activities under Article 12 (<span class=""highlight"">CDM</span>) only in the first commitment period, or whether it also applies to <span class=""highlight"">future commitment</span> periods. Other issues included the Russian FederationÂ’s proposal for an amendment to its cap on <span class=""highlight"">forest</span> management credits contained in Appendix Z, and additional concerns regarding Party caps."
lulucf|afforestation|reforestation,"Co-Chair Dovland noted that issues identified that could not be resolved by the negotiating group would be presented to President Pronk for his guidance, and Appendix Z would not be opened at this time. Six requests with regard to Appendix Z would be referred to President Pronk, as well as questions regarding the cap on credits to offset Article 3.3 (<span class=""highlight"">afforestation</span>, <span class=""highlight"">reforestation</span> and <span class=""highlight"">deforestation</span>) debits, and the applicability of the decision on eligibility of <span class=""highlight"">LULUCF</span> activities under Article 12 beyond the first commitment period. The drafting group agreed on the Co-ChairsÃ¯Â¿Â½ decisions in the evening with the exception of the issues to be referred to President Pronk."
adverse effects/impacts|funding|lulucf|technology|technology transfer,"Much of the talk in the corridors Thursday evening was on the progress of the various negotiating groups in clearing the numerous remaining draft decisions and accompanying texts. While success was reported in areas such as <span class=""highlight"">technology</span> transfer, <span class=""highlight"">funding</span>, <span class=""highlight"">LULUCF</span> and <span class=""highlight"">adverse effects</span>, talks on the mechanisms appeared to be moving at a less impressive pace, while those on compliance seemed to be stalled. An overriding disagreement that resurfaced concerns the legal nature of the procedures and mechanisms relating to compliance. While several participants at COP-6 Part II felt some Parties were trying to reinterpret MondayÃ¯Â¿Â½s result, sympathizers said the caution in some of ThursdayÃ¯Â¿Â½s groups reflected a concern that the talks were running the risk of rushing through texts that could consequently be error-laden.

These countries, known under the UNFCCC as Annex I Parties, committed themselves to reducing their overall <span class=""highlight"">emissions</span> of six greenhouse <span class=""highlight"">gases</span> by at least 5% below <span class=""highlight"">1990 levels</span> over the period between 2008 and 2012, with specific targets varying from country to country.

CHINA suggested that each Party should focus on promoting public awareness on the <span class=""highlight"">IPCC</span> <span class=""highlight"">TAR</span>, and MAURITIUS said Article 6 implementation should take place at the grassroots level in both developed and developing countries. The IUCN offered to contribute to carrying out the necessary work through its Commission on <span class=""highlight"">Education</span> and Communication, a global network of experts. Chair Dovland said Parties were clearly calling for more action and noted that informal consultations would be held on the elaboration of draft conclusions."

He stressed that details should be left to be defined in the <span class=""highlight"">IPCC</span> good practice guidance. SAUDI ARABIA proposed introducing additional subparagraphs requiring Parties to submit information on, _inter alia_, how the reported activities exclude <span class=""highlight"">carbon dioxide</span> removals due to indirect human-induced effects.

On the <span class=""highlight"">facilitative branch</span>, JAPAN put forward a proposal intended to reflect the language in the <span class=""highlight"">Bonn Agreements</span> on the type of questions of implementation to be addressed. The G-77/CHINA said the proposal required further clarification.

The EU highlighted that the Party-to- Party <span class=""highlight"">triggering</span> option was useful for the effectiveness and balance of the compliance procedures. With IRAN, he said that if questions could be indicated in the reports of ERTs, <span class=""highlight"">sovereign</span> states should also have the possibility to make submissions against another Party. SAMOA stressed that procedures are non-adversarial, multilateral in nature and include due-process provisions. JAPAN, opposed by CHINA, suggested that <span class=""highlight"">triggering</span> against another Party could be limited to the <span class=""highlight"">facilitative branch</span>. Co-Chair Dovland said this issue was not of a drafting nature and would thus be forwarded to the Plenary."

The RUSSIAN FEDERATION suggested that the information considered by the branch be made available to the public after the conclusion of the process. SWITZERLAND and NORWAY highlighted the existence of due process provisions in, and the need to be consistent with, the text on Protocol Articles 5, 7 and 8."
enforcement,"On the procedures for the <span class=""highlight"">enforcement</span> branch, the RUSSIAN FEDERATION, opposed by the EU, suggested text reflecting the right for the Party concerned to have a closed hearing.

Regarding Protocol Article 3.14 (<span class=""highlight"">adverse effects</span>), Chair Dovland noted that it is referred to, in brackets, in the draft guidelines and corresponding draft decisions, and that the options involve whether or not reporting problems should lead to non-compliance and loss of mechanisms eligibility. He suggested instituting an additional review within the annual review for Article 3.14, but no loss of eligibility, as a compromise solution. AOSIS, NEW ZEALAND, CG-11, AUSTRALIA and the EU supported continued work based on the proposal. The G-77/ CHINA supported an annual desk review and a periodic review in conjunction with national communications. JAPAN, with a number of other Annex I Parties, indicated that he did not consider reporting under Article 3.14 to be mandatory, and could not accept a link to mechanisms eligibility.

In the morning, Parties discussed whether to consider the revision of the terms of reference for the CGE or the guidelines for the preparation of national communications from non-Annex I Parties first. At the end of the first meeting, it was agreed to begin with the terms of reference. Parties discussed language in this document referring to <span class=""highlight"">LDCs</span>. Several <span class=""highlight"">LDCs</span> noted that the CGE did not have a mandate to address the <span class=""highlight"">LDC</span> <span class=""highlight"">NAPA</span> process. The EU stressed linkages between the processes of preparing national communications and <span class=""highlight"">NAPAs</span>. Text referring to <span class=""highlight"">LDCs</span> was bracketed. On the composition of the CGE, the G-77/ CHINA requested removal of the expert from non-Annex I Parties in Europe proposed in the new terms of reference.

ldcs,"Delegates to COP-7 met in negotiating and drafting groups on the mechanisms, compliance and Protocol Articles 5 (methodological issues), 7 (communication of information) and 8 (review of information). In addition, the drafting group on <span class=""highlight"">LDCs</span> continued its work, and informal groups met on a number of issues, including on the Consultative Group of Experts (CGE)."
cdm,"MECHANISMS:   Delegates met in morning and afternoon sessions of the mechanisms negotiating group to consider remaining issues relating to Protocol Articles 12 (<span class=""highlight"">CDM</span>), 6 (<span class=""highlight"">joint implementation</span>), 17 (<span class=""highlight"">emissions</span> trading) and 7.4 (assigned amounts)."
cdm,"On the designated <span class=""highlight"">operational entities</span> of the <span class=""highlight"">CDM</span>, Parties approved the Co- ChairsÂ’ revised COP draft decision whereby host Parties, before the submission of a validation report to the Executive Board, should provide written support that projects fulfill host country sustainable <span class=""highlight"">development</span> objectives. BRAZIL, with CHINA and SAMOA, urged reference to a formal letter of agreement. On alternate members to the Executive Board, Parties expressed divergent views on membersÂ’ roles and responsibilities. The matter was referred to informal consultations."

NORWAY called for further consultations. On the election of the Board, SAMOA, with the EU and BULGARIA, called for consideration of <span class=""highlight"">gender</span> balance."
cers|assigned amount units,"On Article 17, Parties failed to reach agreement on several elements relating to the commitment period reserve, including whether to consider ERUs and <span class=""highlight"">CERs</span> for the first commitment period. Delegates agreed to revisit the draft decisions pending deliberations on Article 7.4. AUSTRALIA, JAPAN and CANADA said that Parties, upon establishment of their assigned amount and until expiration of the additional period for fulfilling commitments, should not make a transfer resulting in these holdings falling below the required commitment period reserve level. The EU, G-77/CHINA, SAMOA and SWITZERLAND supported the use of shall. SWITZERLAND noted the need for mandatory requirements to maintain the integrity of the <span class=""highlight"">Bonn Agreements</span>. The issue was forwarded to ministers. On the actions to be taken if calculations raise a PartyÂ’s required level of commitment period reserve above the PartyÂ’s holdings of ERUs, <span class=""highlight"">CERs</span> and <span class=""highlight"">AAUs</span>, AUSTRALIA and CANADA supported reference to recommended level. Co-Chair Chow, supported by the EU and G-77/ CHINA, urged reference to required. The issue was forwarded to ministers, noting that Co- Chair ChowÂ’s proposal enjoyed majority support."
supplementarity|lulucf|compliance system,"On the draft COP decision on principles, nature and scope of the mechanisms, CANADA and JAPAN, opposed by the EU, G-77/CHINA and SAMOA, proposed deleting text emphasizing that environmental integrity is to be achieved through sound modalities, rules and guidelines for the mechanisms, strict principles and rules governing <span class=""highlight"">LULUCF</span>, and a strong <span class=""highlight"">compliance regime</span>. After some discussion, the original text was retained, with reference to strict being replaced with sound and strong. Consideration of the related draft COP/MOP decision continued in an afternoon session, with Co-Chair Chow suggesting deleting a paragraph specifying that the provisions on the use of mechanisms shall apply individually for Parties acting under Article 4 (joint fulfillment), on the understanding that in Bonn the <span class=""highlight"">flexibility</span> on <span class=""highlight"">supplementarity</span> was given to some countries in exchange of the deletion of text on Article 4. AUSTRALIA, CANADA and JAPAN opposed the deletion, arguing, _inter alia,_ that broader issues of transparency and good governance were involved. The paragraph was referred to the ministers."
cers|additional activities|afforestation|reforestation,"The negotiating group then considered the Co-ChairsÂ’ Article 7.4 non-paper. Delegates exchanged views and articulated their respective positions on, _inter alia_: the fixed or dynamic nature of assigned amounts; the possibility to restrict the use of mechanisms depending on a PartyÂ’s ratification of the Protocol; the definition of assigned amount as a level or a volume of units; the need for a new concept to identify units resulting from project activities under Protocol Article 3.3 (<span class=""highlight"">afforestation</span>, <span class=""highlight"">reforestation</span>, <span class=""highlight"">deforestation</span>) and 3.4 (<span class=""highlight"">additional activities</span>), or the possibility for transparency concerns to be covered by the existence of a unit serial number; the possibility of setting limits on the transferability of <span class=""highlight"">CERs</span>, banking and carry-over; and the distinction, if any, between subtraction and transfer of units, and between acquisition and addition of units. The EU, SAMOA and AUSTRALIA suggested that differences in opinion could be bridged by moving the debate away from conceptual approaches and toward a discussion of their consequences."
lulucf,"PROTOCOL ARTICLES 5, 7 AND 8:   The negotiating group on Articles 5, 7 and 8 met in an evening session to take stock of the work of the drafting groups, which had met throughout the day. Drafting group Chair Plume reported from the <span class=""highlight"">LULUCF</span> group, noting three areas of contention: issues linked to outcomes from the mechanisms and Article 7.4 groups; reporting on area of land; and incorporation of <span class=""highlight"">LULUCF</span> principles into the texts. She said she had prepared a ChairÂ’s proposal, and that the new text would be distributed Tuesday morning."
lulucf|expert review,"Regarding work on non-<span class=""highlight"">LULUCF</span> matters, drafting group Chair Luboyera noted some progress, but said work had not been completed in the time available. He said a number of issues related to the <span class=""highlight"">Expert Review</span> Teams had been resolved, although disagreements remained over their composition. Regarding thresholds, he stated that the issue was being considered as a package, and was not yet resolved. He said more consultations on Article 3.14 (<span class=""highlight"">adverse effects</span>) were needed among some regional groups, and some outstanding issues remained on mandatory aspects. On confidentiality, he said a decision paragraph had been suggested requesting SBSTA-17 to consider views from Parties on the matter."
supplementarity,"CHINA indicated that it had prepared a proposal on <span class=""highlight"">supplementarity</span> under Article 7.2 (national communications). SAUDI ARABIA highlighted a proposal on the commitment period reserve, BRAZIL proposed language on the final review report of the ERTs, and JAPAN said it had a new proposal on a new procedure for the final compilation report. These proposals were not discussed further due to time constraints."
non-annex i national communications|ldcs|annex i national communications,"CGE:   The CGE contact group met in a brief morning and a longer evening session to discuss and agree on two revised draft decisions. The evening session was co-chaired by SBI Chair Ashe and Chair Ojoo-Massawa. Parties first discussed the draft decision on improving the guidelines for the preparation of <span class=""highlight"">non-Annex I national communications. They addressed at length the timing for three issues: the improvement and adoption of the guidelines; the preparation of draft improved guidelines and a workshop to be held on this; and the submission by Parties of proposals on the draft guidelines to the Secretariat. UGANDA, for the LDCs, supported adopting the improved guidelines at COP-10, while the G-77/ CHINA preferred COP-9. The US, with AUSTRALIA, supported doing this at COP-8, underscoring the relevant COP-5 decision that had scheduled this for COP-7, and stressed that it was not acceptable to postpone this for longer than one year. SBI Chair Ashe proposed COP-8 for the adoption of the improved guidelines, that the workshop be held prior to the 16th session of the subsidiary bodies, and that proposals on these guidelines by Parties be submitted by 5 August 2002 for consideration at SBI-17. Delegates agreed.</span>"

The G-77/CHINA stressed the importance of a paragraph on evaluating the real cost of preparing national communications. The EU, with AUSTRALIA, highlighted that this skill-set was not present in the CGE, and supported deleting the paragraph. Parties agreed. Outstanding issues then related to dates for workshops to be held, and the review of the terms of reference for the CGE. The G-77/CHINA proposed two workshops be held in 2002, and that the terms of reference be reviewed at COP-8, to which delegates agreed."

supplementarity|lulucf,"Several delegates were expressing concern Monday evening as a stock-taking Plenary was canceled due to the pressing need to continue talks in negotiating and drafting groups. Although the Bureau seemed confident that substantial progress could be made overnight, some observers were skeptical that major breakthroughs would occur on the remaining big issues, suggesting that delegates would hold on to negotiating capital until closer to the high- level segment due to start Wednesday. As the COP-7 countdown continued, several participants appeared anxious at the number of issues still to be resolved. Key areas of contention include eligibility criteria on the mechanisms, the commitment period reserve under Article 17, applicable consequences in relation to compliance, and reporting on <span class=""highlight"">LULUCF</span> and <span class=""highlight"">supplementarity</span>. In addition, Article 7.4 is a cross-cutting issue that many feel has not yet entered a substantive negotiating stage. In spite of this heavy agenda, however, optimists point out that all these outstanding issues could be resolved by the end of the conference."

Delegates then adopted draft conclusions on the calendar of meetings of Convention bodies 2005-2007 and on feasibility of developing guidelines for the review of <span class=""highlight"">Annex I national communications</span>, and recommended to the COP a draft decision on the review of the third national communications and the roster of experts. The SBI forwarded to the COP a draft decision on the third compilation and synthesis of initial national communications from non-Annex I Parties. On the CGE, Contact Group Chair Ojoo-Massawa stressed that paragraphs relating to <span class=""highlight"">NAPAs</span> and the <span class=""highlight"">LDC</span> Expert Group remained bracketed pending discussions in the <span class=""highlight"">LDC</span> group. Approval of the relevant draft decisions was deferred."
lulucf,"Delegates then turned to outstanding <span class=""highlight"">LULUCF</span> issues in the Article 7 guidelines and the related COP/MOP-1 decision. After extensive discussion, including compromise proposals from several Parties and Chair Dovland, the <span class=""highlight"">LULUCF</span> package was forwarded to ministers, with the main area of contention being whether the <span class=""highlight"">LULUCF</span> principles as included in the <span class=""highlight"">Bonn Agreements</span> should lead to specific, mandatory reporting requirements within the Article 7 guidelines or should remain preambular guiding principles."
supplementarity|trigger,"Resuming in an evening session, the group considered the bracketed text on review of information under Protocol Article 3.14 (<span class=""highlight"">adverse effects</span>) in guidelines under Article 8. Chair Dovland highlighted a compromise proposal supporting annual as well as periodic reporting and review of information under Article 3.14, and said the key starting point is whether such reporting should <span class=""highlight"">trigger</span> loss of mechanisms eligibility. Parties did not reach agreement on this. On a new Russian proposal on confidentiality, Parties raised concerns and the issue was not resolved. On <span class=""highlight"">supplementarity</span> in the guidelines under Article 7, the US, supported by CANADA, highlighted the lack of legal context of a Chinese proposal specifying the aim of reducing <span class=""highlight"">per capita</span> <span class=""highlight"">emissions</span> differences between developed and developing countries. Work is expected to continue in informal consultations."
facilitative branch|trigger,"COMPLIANCE:   The negotiating group on compliance met in an evening session to consider the new Co-ChairsÂ’ non-paper on compliance, an EU/Umbrella Group proposed compliance package, as well as new text for a draft COP decision. CANADA introduced the package proposal, highlighting that it focused on <span class=""highlight"">trigger</span>, appeal, compliance action plan and suspension of eligibility to make transfers under Article 17. The G-77/CHINA and the ENVIRONMENTAL INTEGRITY GROUP supported the package. The NETHERLANDS then reported on the outcome of consultations on outstanding issues not reflected in the Co-ChairsÂ’ new non- paper. On the mandate of the <span class=""highlight"">facilitative branch</span>, he reported agreement on the deletion of wording specifying that it was the only branch responsible for addressing questions of implementation. On the consequences applied by the <span class=""highlight"">facilitative branch</span>, he said delegates had agreed that these be applied taking into account, rather than on the basis of, the principle of common but <span class=""highlight"">differentiated responsibilities</span> and respective capabilities. Delegates agreed to the new Co-ChairsÂ’ non-paper on procedures and mechanisms, as amended. Everton Vargas (Brazil) then reported on consultations he facilitated on the draft COP decision and recommended that the group adopt his proposed draft decision, with an editorial amendment. Delegates agreed, thus completing the work of the negotiating group."

Mechanisms group Co-Chairs Estrada and Chow reported progress, although some controversial issues from the three drafting groups remained in the text to be submitted to ministers. On Articles 5, 7 and 8, Chair Dovland highlighted two issues delegates had been unable to resolve, namely reporting on <span class=""highlight"">LULUCF</span> activities, and review and consequences of failure to report on Article 3.14. He suggested that, with the completion of the work on compliance, this issue might be more easily resolved, and noted that the groupÃ¯Â¿Â½s work on Article 7.4 could not be finalized until related work in the mechanisms group had been completed."
compliance system,"There was both joy and disappointment at COP-7 Tuesday night as negotiators cut a deal on compliance but fell short of the mark on the mechanisms and Articles 5, 7 and 8. Although there were handshakes and hugs as the <span class=""highlight"">compliance group</span> finished its work, some observers were already speculating on possible trade-offs involved in securing the deal. The mood in the mechanisms group was more muted. Although the Co-ChairsÃ¯Â¿Â½ new text is free of brackets, it was apparent that a number of key issues had yet to be resolved. On an optimistic note, however, some said that although the paper was not an agreed document, it was better to have a clean text that was not universally supported than one littered with brackets."

In addition, several speakers noted that the events of 11 September demonstrate the need for multilateral solutions to global problems that cannot be tackled by just one country. A number of delegates drew attention to the <span class=""highlight"">IPCC</span> <span class=""highlight"">TAR</span>, which demonstrates the need for urgent action to address climate change, and paid tribute to both COP-6 President Pronk and UNFCCC Executive Secretary Michael Zammit Cutajar."

BELGIUM, for the EU, highlighted outstanding issues on the mechanisms requiring resolution, including the election of the Executive Board of the <span class=""highlight"">CDM</span>. BULGARIA, for CG-11, CYPRUS and MALTA, noted the special circumstances of these individual countries in fulfilling their commitments. CANADA highlighted the need to be responsive to those whose participation is critical to <span class=""highlight"">entry into force</span> of the Protocol. SWEDEN said success in Marrakesh would constitute a powerful pledge for the US to reconsider its decision to be part of a global coalition to combat climate change."

SOUTH AFRICA, for the G-77/China, reiterated concerns on the <span class=""highlight"">GEF</span> adding conditionalities to access the <span class=""highlight"">SCCF</span> and suggested that the review of the <span class=""highlight"">financial mechanism</span> be addressed by SBI-22. On the review of the <span class=""highlight"">financial mechanism</span>, the EU recommended considering the results of the <span class=""highlight"">GEF</span> Third Overall Performance Study. The US and CANADA said parameters from the previous review could be used."
technology|technology transfer,"<span class=""highlight"">TECHNOLOGY</span> TRANSFER:   This contact group was co-chaired by Kishan Kumarsingh (Trinidad and Tobago) and Holger Liptow (Germany). Co-Chair Kumarsingh explained that SBSTA had requested the group to prepare draft conclusions and a draft decision. JAPAN, supported by the US, noted that the group did not need to produce a draft decision. BANGLADESH proposed to consider biotechnology as a <span class=""highlight"">technology</span> for carbon capture. The US, supported by CANADA, stated that <span class=""highlight"">technology</span> transfer should be considered in the context of Article 4.5 (<span class=""highlight"">technology</span> transfer). The G-77/CHINA called for targeted <span class=""highlight"">financial support</span> for the enhancement of indigenous technologies and <span class=""highlight"">technology</span> transfer, and joint research between developed and developing countries. He proposed that the UNFCCC <span class=""highlight"">technology</span> clearing house (TT:CLEAR) be funded by the core budget. Some delegates proposed that the Secretariat compile a report on <span class=""highlight"">technology</span> needs derived from national reports. Others said such work is already being done by other organizations."
adaptation and response measures|models|emissions scenarios|inaction,"PRESENTATIONS:   Richard Klein, Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research, Germany, addressed the research demands generated by adaptation to climate change. He noted that <span class=""highlight"">scenarios</span> and <span class=""highlight"">models</span> used to assess <span class=""highlight"">climate change impacts</span> are not always useful for assessing adaptation. Klein signaled a mismatch between impact research that uses <span class=""highlight"">models</span> with large spatial and temporal scales, and adaptation research that uses qualitative methods based on local data with a shorter-term approach. He suggested that research should seek to match <span class=""highlight"">impact assessment</span> with adaptation assessment, and incorporate local conditions to provide decision makers with information that is temporally and spatially pertinent. He said such assessments should identify the probability of impacts, the costs and benefits of different <span class=""highlight"">adaptation measures</span> and the <span class=""highlight"">opportunity costs</span> of <span class=""highlight"">inaction</span> in this field."
vulnerable|uncertainties|models,"In the ensuing discussion, participants highlighted the value of local knowledge. Klein said that all knowledge Â– local and traditional Â– should be considered and subject to the same scrutiny as conventional scientific knowledge. FRANCE asked how climate <span class=""highlight"">models</span> could help authorities address severe weather occurrences such as heat waves, and Klein explained that in this case <span class=""highlight"">vulnerable</span> sectors are determined by social factors not related to climate. Responding to a question concerning the <span class=""highlight"">uncertainty</span> of these <span class=""highlight"">models</span>, Klein replied that all <span class=""highlight"">models</span> have a measure of <span class=""highlight"">uncertainty</span>, as does adaptation research, and therefore researchers must seek to identify and reduce <span class=""highlight"">uncertainty</span> to the largest extent possible."
uncertainties|models,"Linda Mearns, National Center for Atmospheric Research, US, presented on the use of regional climate <span class=""highlight"">models</span> in <span class=""highlight"">impact assessments</span> and adaptation studies. She noted that regional <span class=""highlight"">models</span> are particularly useful in assessing the <span class=""highlight"">impact of climate change</span> in islands, mountains, coastlines and areas of complex land- use patterns. She said regional <span class=""highlight"">models</span> could help to bridge the gap between Â“top-downÂ” standards and Â“<span class=""highlight"">bottom-up</span>Â” adaptation, but noted that such <span class=""highlight"">models</span> must account for <span class=""highlight"">uncertainties</span> of future <span class=""highlight"">emissions</span> pathways. She emphasized that regional and global <span class=""highlight"">models</span> are useful tools, but that their limitations should be recognized."
uncertainties|models,"JAMAICA asked if regional <span class=""highlight"">models</span> had been developed for the Caribbean. Mearns pointed to regional climate assessments funded by the <span class=""highlight"">GEF</span>. CHINA commented on <span class=""highlight"">uncertainties</span> in using global climate <span class=""highlight"">models</span>. Mearns said that although <span class=""highlight"">models</span> have become more sophisticated, assessments would benefit from including local knowledge."
models|uncertainties|emissions scenarios|energy,"Rupa Kumar Kolli, The <span class=""highlight"">Energy</span> and Resources Institute, India, presented his experience in applying regional high-resolution <span class=""highlight"">models</span> in climate change <span class=""highlight"">scenarios</span> for India. He highlighted that local topographic characteristics are important to define the intensity of climate phenomena such as monsoons. He demonstrated how global model simulations have insufficient detail for country-level assessments, and how regional <span class=""highlight"">models</span> that operate on a 50 km2 resolution provide more accurate results even if they use data taken from global <span class=""highlight"">models</span>. On the evaluation of the results of regional <span class=""highlight"">models</span>, Kolli underlined that the distribution of weather stations on the ground determines the capacity for evaluation. He said <span class=""highlight"">uncertainty</span> may be reduced by providing more feedback to the system on areas of high <span class=""highlight"">uncertainty</span>, such as coastlines."
vulnerable|climate change impacts|development|sustainable development|water|agriculture,"Judy Lawrence, Ministry of Environment, New Zealand, spoke on tools to assess <span class=""highlight"">vulnerability</span> and adapt to climate change in a temperate developed <span class=""highlight"">agricultural</span> economy. She explained how New Zealand is enabling <span class=""highlight"">farmers</span> to address the <span class=""highlight"">impacts of climate change</span>, by extending seasonal <span class=""highlight"">crop</span> growth, diversifying types of <span class=""highlight"">crops</span>, and providing access to reliable climate information. She noted that <span class=""highlight"">top-down </span>assessments of impacts and <span class=""highlight"">vulnerability</span> in the <span class=""highlight"">agricultural</span> sector have previously failed to reach <span class=""highlight"">farmers</span>, but that stakeholder participation in assessments is becoming more common. She noted that New Zealand is also developing a national sustainable <span class=""highlight"">development</span> action plan on <span class=""highlight"">water</span>."
vulnerable,"Marjorie Soto Franco, Red Cross Nicaragua, spoke on the general approach, strategy and methods used for preparing for climate-related <span class=""highlight"">disasters</span> in a pilot project carried out on the Caribbean coast of Nicaragua. She said the Red CrossÂ’ climate change programme aims to link climate change experts and <span class=""highlight"">disaster</span> preparedness communities at all levels through awareness raising, capacity building and advocacy. Describing the <span class=""highlight"">participatory</span> nature of the project, she noted that it addresses climate risks through the <span class=""highlight"">development</span> of methods and tools, the creation of institutional dialogue, and the assessment of <span class=""highlight"">vulnerability</span> and capacity."

He noted the unique temperature and <span class=""highlight"">precipitation</span> characteristics of the Arctic, and highlighted that the impacts are more severe and rapid than in other regions. Correll underlined that the assessment, which draws on a variety of sources, including indigenous knowledge, has identified that in the next 100 years temperatures are expected to change by as much as 10 degrees Celsius in some regions of the Arctic. He stated that as ice disappears, livelihoods will be affected by changes in <span class=""highlight"">ecosystems</span> and animal range areas, and by the appearance of new <span class=""highlight"">maritime</span> <span class=""highlight"">transport</span> routes. He explained that there is evidence of <span class=""highlight"">ocean</span> salinity loss due to massive quantities of <span class=""highlight"">water</span> flowing from ice-caps and that this will affect the <span class=""highlight"">thermohaline</span> <span class=""highlight"">ocean</span> circulation, thus severely altering one of the main regulators of the climate."
funding|land use|investment,"Joseph Konno, Environmental Protection Agency, Micronesia, reviewed a project in his country that uses a Â“climate proofingÂ” risk-based approach to adaptation. He reviewed the projectÂ’s application to road surface improvements, <span class=""highlight"">land-use</span> planning regulatory amendments, and national strategic <span class=""highlight"">development</span> planning. Noting challenges such as data scarcity, limited resources, and difficulties in accessing <span class=""highlight"">funding</span> and defining acceptable risk, he said climate-proofed <span class=""highlight"">development</span> projects minimize long-term costs and improve long-term return on <span class=""highlight"">investment</span>."
food|ecosystem|climate change impacts|water|food security,"Osvaldo Canziani, Universal Ecological Foundation, Argentina, spoke on the fate of indigenous communities in the context of climate change. He noted the work of the Millennium <span class=""highlight"">Ecosystem</span> Assessment and said that <span class=""highlight"">indigenous peoples </span>are challenged by several environmental issues, including climate change. He pointed to <span class=""highlight"">food</span> insecurity and <span class=""highlight"">water</span> scarcity as two <span class=""highlight"">impacts of climate change</span> on indigenous peoples, noting that access to <span class=""highlight"">water</span> will be reduced dramatically by 2080."

He stated that without taking appropriate action to adapt to climate change, the sustainable <span class=""highlight"">development</span> of <span class=""highlight"">SIDS</span> will be seriously impaired. BRAZIL pointed to the Regional Climate Change <span class=""highlight"">Scenarios</span> for South America programme that will provide information on <span class=""highlight"">climate change impacts</span>, <span class=""highlight"">vulnerability</span> assessments and adaptation, and said the information will be accessible to South American countries."
vulnerable|mitigation actions,"The EU noted that adaptation is a short- to medium-term response to climate variability that cannot counter the long-term <span class=""highlight"">impacts of climate change</span>. With JAPAN, he noted that more effective <span class=""highlight"">action on mitigation</span> is required to avoid exceeding critical thresholds. CANADA supported a <span class=""highlight"">vulnerability</span> approach to inform adaptation decision making. He said adaptation is not a new issue, and needs to be understood in the context of risk management. The INTERNATIONAL STRATEGY ON <span class=""highlight"">DISASTER</span> REDUCTION stressed links between adaptation, and risk management and reduction. Noting that the risk management community has many tools to offer, he encouraged greater engagement between the adaptation and risk management communities."

lulucf,"Thursday was a quiet day according to many delegates, so quiet that no country was awarded the coveted fossil of the day prize by environmental NGOs. The day was dominated by an in-session workshop on mitigation, which was endorsed by many Parties as a success. Some suspect that this may be the calm before the <span class=""highlight"">storm</span> over whether or how to discuss <span class=""highlight"">post-2012</span> actions. In other corners of the conference hall, delegates were in high spirits after informally reaching agreement on the draft decision text on <span class=""highlight"">LULUCF</span> good practice guidance."
cdm|financial mechanism|ldcs|education|lulucf|harvested wood products|technology transfer|technology,"Delegates to COP-10 met in a SBSTA plenary and numerous contact groups on Friday. In the morning, SBSTA discussed scientific, technical and socioeconomic aspects of mitigation of climate change (mitigation) and a COP contact group took up the report of the <span class=""highlight"">CDM</span> Executive Board (EB). SBI contact groups met throughout the day on: capacity building; the UNFCCCÂ’s <span class=""highlight"">financial mechanism</span>; UNFCCC Article 6 (<span class=""highlight"">education</span>, <span class=""highlight"">training and public awareness</span>); and matters relating to <span class=""highlight"">least developed countries</span> (<span class=""highlight"">LDCs</span>). SBSTA contact groups addressed: good practice guidance (GPG) on <span class=""highlight"">LULUCF</span> activities under the Protocol, harvested <span class=""highlight"">wood</span> products (HWP) and other issues relating to <span class=""highlight"">LULUCF</span>; mitigation; and <span class=""highlight"">technology</span> transfer."

Many Parties welcomed the workshop and supported holding additional in-session workshops at future SBSTA sessions. CHINA, for the G-77/China, underscored that mitigation should not result in <span class=""highlight"">adverse impacts</span> on <span class=""highlight"">development</span>, and urged Parties to establish an international mechanism for <span class=""highlight"">technology</span> <span class=""highlight"">innovation</span>, <span class=""highlight"">development</span> and transfer. JAPAN, with many others, stressed the relevance of <span class=""highlight"">energy</span> efficiency. He said <span class=""highlight"">international cooperation</span> on this area should be carried out on a sectoral basis. The EU emphasized that mitigation is key, and noted that significant greenhouse <span class=""highlight"">gas</span> reductions are technically and economically feasible."
small island|mitigation and adaptation|technology|technology transfer,"UGANDA said mitigation can be considered a form of adaptation, since mitigating early avoids future costs of adaptation. AUSTRALIA highlighted the complimentary roles of <span class=""highlight"">adaptation and mitigation</span>. TUVALU stressed that, while adaptation is necessary, particularly in <span class=""highlight"">SIDS</span>, a commitment to mitigation is equally important. Acknowledging the merits of information exchange, he said that the workshop demonstrated that sufficient information and <span class=""highlight"">technology</span> are available for action."
transport|renewable energy|energy,"Numerous Parties provided suggestions for presentation topics at subsequent SBSTA workshops. SAUDI ARABIA said the workshop should address socioeconomic aspects of mitigation. AOSIS stressed the importance of <span class=""highlight"">renewable energy technologies. CHILE said that transport had not been sufficiently addressed during the workshop. CANADA proposed addressing sectoral case studies. Chair Benrageb established a contact group on the issue co-chaired by Kok Seng Yap (Malaysia) and Toshiyuki Sakamoto (Japan).</span>"
eit|economies in transition,"CAPACITY BUILDING:   Co-Chair Roger Cornforth requested views from delegates on a proposal submitted by the G-77/China to serve as a basis for negotiations on the draft decision on capacity building. The EU, with JAPAN, US, AUSTRALIA and CANADA, stated that they could not accept the text, which he said does not correspond to the agreed terms of reference. JAPAN stressed that the review of the capacity-building frameworks should address neither future activities nor guidance to the <span class=""highlight"">GEF</span>. The G-77/CHINA emphasized that the proposed text represents the view of over 100 developing countries that are affected by the decision. The EU, supported by the US, CANADA and JAPAN, and opposed by the G-77/CHINA, proposed that the Co-Chairs prepare a new draft decision text. Co-Chair Cornforth invited new proposals for the draft decision from other Parties. Discussions continued informally on capacity building in countries with <span class=""highlight"">economies in transition</span>."

Delegates addressed <span class=""highlight"">funding</span> needs for developing countries to meet their commitments under the UNFCCC in the context of decision 5/CP.8 (review of the <span class=""highlight"">financial mechanism</span>). SOUTH AFRICA, for the G-77/China, said that, in accordance with the Memorandum of Understanding between the <span class=""highlight"">GEF</span> and the COP, the COP and <span class=""highlight"">GEF</span> should jointly determine the necessary <span class=""highlight"">funding</span>. The US, CANADA, EU and JAPAN supported maintaining the existing modalities for identifying <span class=""highlight"">funding</span>. On the process for the review of the <span class=""highlight"">financial mechanism</span>, the EU, CANADA, JAPAN and US said that existing guidelines should be used. The G-77/CHINA requested time for further consultations. Co-Chair Moore invited Parties to hold informal consultations on these issues."
cdm|additionality|cdm projects|transport|energy efficiency|energy,"<span class=""highlight"">CDM</span> EB:   Delegates discussed the draft decision text on the <span class=""highlight"">CDM</span> EB.     Regarding the implications of <span class=""highlight"">CDM</span> project activities for achieving objectives of other environmental agreements, the EU suggested highlighting in particular the <span class=""highlight"">Montreal Protocol</span> on Substances that Deplete the <span class=""highlight"">Ozone</span> Layer. BRAZIL, opposed by the US, expressed concern about the costs of facilitating the physical presence of observers at EB meetings. INDIA recommended preambular text on the definition of Â“<span class=""highlight"">additionality</span>.Â” JAPAN, opposed by CANADA and BRAZIL, suggested text restraining the EB from holding closed sessions, and text requesting the EB to develop guidance on, _inter alia_, methodologies for <span class=""highlight"">energy</span> efficiency and for <span class=""highlight"">transport</span> sector <span class=""highlight"">CDM</span> projects. INDIA suggested text on an EB database of approved methodologies and text on procedures for the amendment of approved methodologies on the basis of experience gained. He also proposed noting that the use of Â“tools for the demonstration and assessment of <span class=""highlight"">additionality</span>Â” is not mandatory for project participants, and, opposed by the EU, recommended text noting, _inter alia_, that a number of Parties have expressed concern about the status of the tools. The EU recommended text requesting the EB to intensify its efforts to facilitate efficient and transparent decisions by the EB and its panels."
mitigation options|technology|technology transfer,"Many Parties suggested considering costs and benefits, as well as co-benefits of <span class=""highlight"">mitigation options</span>. SAUDI ARABIA and CANADA proposed considering <span class=""highlight"">national circumstances</span>, and NEW ZEALAND suggested looking at examples of national policies that address least-cost mitigation approaches. Many delegates said the workshop should focus on more than one theme and include cross-cutting issues. CHINA proposed communicating the conclusions to the Expert Group on <span class=""highlight"">Technology</span> Transfer (EGTT). The US, supported by NEW ZEALAND, recommended involving practitioners. CANADA said it is too early to negotiate terms of reference for the workshop. Parties will submit their views and the Co-Chairs will prepare draft conclusions for further consideration by the contact group."
gef|lcd expert group|national adaptation programmes of action|ldcs|ldc fund|funding|napa,"<span class=""highlight"">LDCS</span>:   This contact group discussed matters relating to <span class=""highlight"">LDCs</span>. Noting     that the mandate of the <span class=""highlight"">LDC</span> Expert Group (<span class=""highlight"">LEG</span>) runs through 2005, the EU proposed discussing the <span class=""highlight"">LEG</span>Â’s work and the extension of its mandate at COP-11. TANZANIA, on behalf of <span class=""highlight"">LDCs</span>, agreed, suggesting that the <span class=""highlight"">LEG</span> provide guidance on implementation of <span class=""highlight"">national adaptation programmes of action</span> (<span class=""highlight"">NAPAs</span>). On guidance to the <span class=""highlight"">GEF</span> on the <span class=""highlight"">LDC</span> <span class=""highlight"">Fund</span>, <span class=""highlight"">LDCs</span> reaffirmed their support for the principle of full-cost <span class=""highlight"">funding</span>, and emphasized the urgency of adaptation activities. He highlighted difficulties with the sliding scale proposed by the <span class=""highlight"">GEF</span> for co-financing project activities, and suggested discussing a threshold for full financing. JAPAN opposed discussing levels of <span class=""highlight"">funding</span> until <span class=""highlight"">NAPAs</span> are completed and projects are identified. SWITZERLAND, the EU, NORWAY and CANADA supported the <span class=""highlight"">GEF</span>Ã¯Â¿Â½s co-financing requirements, saying that projects should not stand in a vacuum and, since national policies will generally address the most urgent activities, <span class=""highlight"">LDC</span> <span class=""highlight"">Fund</span> projects should complement and build on these efforts. The Co-Chairs will prepare a draft decision for consideration."

The draft stipulates, _ inter alia_, that GPG will be applied in a manner Ã¯Â¿Â½consistentÃ¯Â¿Â½ with the <span class=""highlight"">Marrakesh Accords</span>, and includes a footnote stating that reporting methods contained in the GPG should ensure that land areas subject to <span class=""highlight"">LULUCF</span> activities under Articles 3.3 and 3.4 can be identified. Delegates agreed on the revised draft decision without further amendment."
lulucf|biome,"On factoring out, AUSTRALIA highlighted its proposal calling for a forward- looking dialogue that takes a broad approach to <span class=""highlight"">LULUCF</span> issues. The US, CANADA, JAPAN, NEW ZEALAND, and NORWAY supported this comprehensive approach. BRAZIL, with AOSIS, PERU and ARGENTINA, preferred a focused approach and suggested holding a technical workshop after COP-10 that would consider submissions by Parties and possibly <span class=""highlight"">biome</span>-specific definitions. The US emphasized his countryÃ¯Â¿Â½s position not to engage in discussions beyond the first commitment period."
emissions inventories|gas|emission|intergovernmental panel on climate change,"On HWP, BRAZIL, with many others, welcomed the <span class=""highlight"">IPCC</span>Ã¯Â¿Â½s work on HWP and noted that HWP could be better discussed after completion of the <span class=""highlight"">IPCC</span> Guidelines for <span class=""highlight"">Greenhouse Gas Inventories</span> in 2006. The EU, with NORWAY, and opposed by CANADA, requested that SBSTA seek submissions by Parties on specific national HWP data by 1 August 2005. AUSTRALIA cautioned Parties that inventory reporting should not be altered, stating that inventories should remain Ã¯Â¿Â½pureÃ¯Â¿Â½ and not be linked to political discussions. The US urged Parties to report on HWP in a transparent manner. CHINA said double accounting remains germane and the <span class=""highlight"">IPCC</span> should address this matter. The RUSSIAN FEDERATION said the <span class=""highlight"">IPCC</span> should consider all categories of <span class=""highlight"">emissions</span> and removals from HWP for future accounting. Co-Chair Agyemang-Bonsu will prepare new text on factoring out and HWP."

She outlined amendments to the new draft decision and conclusions paragraph-by-paragraph, and said that Parties had informally resolved, _inter alia, _outstanding_ _issues of bundling, <span class=""highlight"">leakage</span>, and monitoring. Delegates agreed to forward these draft texts to SBSTA."
additionality|cdm,"<span class=""highlight"">CDM</span> EB:   The contact group considered a draft decision text. INDIA and others expressed the need for text on arbitration provisions and on protection for EB members and others from liability. Chair RaÃºl Estrada-Oyuela proposed text stating that the EB shall, where it decides to limit attendance at its meetings, take all practicable steps to accommodate non-Parties to the Protocol and others to observe proceedings, except when the EB decides to close the meeting or a portion of it. The US stressed the need for stronger wording allowing for the physical presence of Protocol non-Parties at meetings and that new text should replace Rule 27 of the EB rules of procedure (attendance). BRAZIL, opposed by JAPAN, said EB meetings should be closed, except on occasions where there are no confidential decisions being taken. The group approved, _inter alia_, preambular text on <span class=""highlight"">additionality</span> and operative text on transparency."

Delegates discussed technical details surrounding the role and tasks of the international <span class=""highlight"">transaction log</span> (<span class=""highlight"">ITL</span>) administrator. The EU suggested adding text to stress that the timely implementation and testing of registry systems is required for the <span class=""highlight"">prompt start</span> of the <span class=""highlight"">CDM</span>. On the relationship between the <span class=""highlight"">ITL</span> and supplementary transaction logs (STLs), BRAZIL said <span class=""highlight"">ITL</span> rules should not be compromised by additional rules relevant to the STLs. Expressing concern about the performance of the <span class=""highlight"">ITL</span>, CHINA proposed requesting the <span class=""highlight"">ITL</span> administrator to conduct testing and independent assessments on the performance of the <span class=""highlight"">ITL</span>, and called for the involvement of both Annex I and non-Annex I Parties. Parties agreed to continue considerations informally."

Consensus was reached on all text except for one paragraph on fossil-<span class=""highlight"">fuel</span> technologies, as it addresses articles other than UNFCCC Article 4.5 (<span class=""highlight"">technology</span> transfer). SAUDI ARABIA proposed to bracket the draft conclusions in their entirety until the paragraph is addressed. The Co-Chairs noted that the paragraph had been forwarded to COP President GonzÃ¡lez GarcÃ­a for consultations. The Co-Chairs also introduced a draft decision based on text presented by the G-77/China. The EU, AUSTRALIA, and other Parties stated that the draft decision could not be discussed until consensus on the draft conclusions is reached. The US said that some Parties are holding the process Â“hostage.Â” Informal consultations on how to proceed will be held."
intergovernmental panel on climate change|lulucf,"<span class=""highlight"">LULUCF</span>:   Co-Chair Audun Rosland presented new draft conclusions on GPG and other issues relating to <span class=""highlight"">LULUCF</span>. AUSTRALIA, with the EU, NEW ZEALAND, NORWAY, JAPAN and SWITZERLAND supported the text, while AOSIS and other Parties expressed reservations on several matters, including a proposed open-ended dialogue. Co-Chair Rosland said the text is intended as a compromise between Parties. On HWP, Parties are unresolved on how the <span class=""highlight"">IPCC</span> should develop methods to estimate, measure and report on HWP in the 2006 <span class=""highlight"">IPCC</span> Guidelines for <span class=""highlight"">Greenhouse Gas Inventories</span>. CANADA stated that the <span class=""highlight"">IPCC</span> should develop methodologies in a Â“neutralÂ” fashion in relation to potential accounting approaches for HWP. AUSTRALIA recommended that the <span class=""highlight"">IPCC</span>Â’s work on HWP should be consistent with definitions under the UNFCCC. AOSIS said that Parties should avoid presuming what the <span class=""highlight"">IPCC</span> is intending to do in its work. Other outstanding issues will be taken up by informal drafting groups."

cdm|afforestation|small-scale afforestation and reforestation|reforestation,"With the sun shining on a beautiful Saturday in Buenos Aires, many delegates found themselves intrigued in side-events and beleaguered in contact groups at La Rural. Many delegates lamented progress on SBI issues, possibly worse than in previous years. As some delegates noted, the intention to block progress on the issues by a small group of countries may be directly related to the fact that the <span class=""highlight"">Kyoto Protocol</span> will soon enter into force. On the other hand, progress was made on some SBSTA issues, with delegates applauding the success of reaching agreement on the rules for small-scale <span class=""highlight"">afforestation</span> and <span class=""highlight"">reforestation</span> activities under the <span class=""highlight"">CDM</span>."

adverse effects/impacts|advers effect policy|models,"<span class=""highlight"">ADVERSE EFFECTS</span>:    Parties reviewed text in a Co-ChairsÂ’ non-paper focusing on the impacts of the implementation of response measures. The EU, US and AUSTRALIA questioned the need for Â“forumsÂ” on insurance for <span class=""highlight"">adverse effects</span> of response measures and on <span class=""highlight"">economic diversification</span> prior to such <span class=""highlight"">adverse effects</span> becoming apparent, but stated that a one-off event on <span class=""highlight"">modeling</span> may be of value. The G-77/CHINA said events on insurance, <span class=""highlight"">modeling</span> and <span class=""highlight"">economic diversification</span> should take place in the form of expert groups. The US, supported by CANADA and the EU, said text on mobilizing resources for implementation should mirror language in decision 5/CP.7. SAUDI ARABIA supported the language in the non-paper, emphasizing the need for action on this issue. Discussions continued informally."
prompt start|cdm,"PROTOCOL ARTICLE 7.4:    Delegates considered a revised draft decision on issues relating to registry systems that had resulted from informal consultations, and worked through the text paragraph-by-paragraph, focusing on paragraphs where previous changes had been made. CANADA preferred to reflect that groups other than Parties are also developing registries, and that appropriate ways to exchange technical information with administrators of similar types of registry systems should be explored. Regarding the test plan and schedules for the initialization of the electronic communications with registry systems, the EU preferred this to be carried out prior to COP/MOP-1 in order to ensure the <span class=""highlight"">prompt start</span> of the <span class=""highlight"">CDM</span>. CHINA expressed concern about the verification of the tests."
lulucf,"<span class=""highlight"">LULUCF</span>:   Eugene Hendrick (Ireland) reported on the informal drafting group on HWP. He proposed new text inviting Parties, _inter alia, _to: submit data and information on HWP if they have not done so already, and provide updated information on experience with the <span class=""highlight"">IPCC</span> 1996 <span class=""highlight"">Greenhouse Gas Inventory</span> Guidelines and the GPG Appendix on the HWP methodological issues, by 1 August 2005. The RUSSIAN FEDERATION cautioned that the HWP methodology should not be addressed prior to the completion of the GPG, as inconsistencies could arise. He also proposed deletion of reference to the GPG Appendix. BRAZIL, for the G-77/China, proposed that submitting data and information on HWP should explicitly apply to Annex I Parties. The US, with CANADA and the EU, proposed that non-Annex I Parties should also be allowed to submit information if they wish to do so. The G-77/CHINA requested time to consult on the issue internally. Following informal discussions, delegates agreed to refer only to Annex I Parties."
lulucf|biome|forest,"Peter Brisbane (Australia), facilitator of the drafting group on the organization of a technical <span class=""highlight"">LULUCF</span> workshop before COP-11, reported that Parties had not been able to reach consensus. AOSIS expressed willingness to move forward on the issue, but emphasized that a dialogue on issues related to the second and subsequent commitment periods must consider wider matters.

Regarding themes for a future SBSTA in-session workshop on mitigation, Parties discussed whether the workshop proposal should specifically mention renewable <span class=""highlight"">energy</span> and efficiency, or regulatory policies and frameworks. SAUDI ARABIA reiterated the need to focus on existing technologies and, opposed by AUSTRALIA, CANADA, US, CHILE, NEW ZEALAND and JAPAN, pointed to the necessity to address the <span class=""highlight"">spillover effects</span> of mitigation. He said <span class=""highlight"">land-use</span> changes and <span class=""highlight"">non-CO2 gases should also be addressed. The EU, supported by the US, proposed addressing co-benefits. Opposed by AUSTRALIA, CANADA, US, CHILE, NEW ZEALAND and JAPAN, the EU, with NORWAY, proposed focusing on energy efficiency</span> and renewables, as well as policy and regulatory frameworks. The US said that he did not object to renewable <span class=""highlight"">energy</span>, but would prefer no reference to it in the text."

South Africa, for the AFRICA GROUP, with INDIA, IRAN and others, supported a short and focused review. The UMBRELLA GROUP (except the US), the EU and SWITZERLAND supported a thorough review of all aspects of the Protocol and, opposed by CHINA, SAUDI ARABIA, INDIA, EGYPT and others, underscored linkages between the AWG and the review. JAPAN highlighted the Â“three tracksÂ” (UNFCCC Dialogue, <span class=""highlight"">Article 9</span> review and AWG), while BRAZIL responded that there are only Â“two tracksÂ” (Dialogue and AWG). SWITZERLAND, supported by the EU and NORWAY, proposed launching a process to conduct the review.

The EU proposed shortening the list of principles and underscored synergies in the <span class=""highlight"">Funds</span> management, procedures and accountability. BRAZIL opposed current references to knowledge and networking expertise. SOUTH AFRICA said the <span class=""highlight"">Fund</span> should ensure decentralized access, mobilize additional resources, and reduce barriers. TUVALU emphasized a community-based approach. The contact group agreed to continue discussions on two tracks by developing a shorter list of principles while keeping the current compilation text.

On a long-term goal, NORWAY called for agreement at COP/MOP 2 and the EU cited its target of stabilizing temperatures at 2C. NORWAY cautioned that national mitigation potential should not be automatically translated into commitments, and encouraged a global perspective. The G-77/CHINA supported an approach beginning with assessment of mitigation potential for Annex I parties and relating this to a possible range of targets or ambition. CANADA called for an examination of policy tools, particularly <span class=""highlight"">LULUCF</span> and, with JAPAN, for <span class=""highlight"">sectoral approaches</span>. The EU said it would be insufficient to look at the potential for only a number of parties. He compared the <span class=""highlight"">Kyoto Protocol</span> to a Nairobi matatu bus, when what is actually needed is a spacecraft. SAUDI ARABIA cautioned against moving away from the Protocol."

The first discussions under Protocol <span class=""highlight"">Article 9</span> were widely anticipated by some, given many peoples view of this as part of the multi-track process on <span class=""highlight"">long-term action</span>. In the event, though, the discussion was viewed as interesting, but not earth-shattering, as parties generally reiterated their known positions."
article 9,"Insiders are discussing the potential impact of the US mid-term elections both in Washington and here in Nairobi. The Democratic Partys change in electoral fortunes seems to have raised expectations massively among the climate policy community, with a number of possibilities viewed on the horizon. Some expect that the passage of various climate-related bills may be accelerated through Congress, and there is even speculation about a real possibility that the new leadership on the Hill may opt to include climate change as a wedge issue in the next Presidential election. It is also expected by some that the political shake up in Washington may end a moratorium on certain fields of study, which some claim has deprived legislators of important research. In Nairobi, observers will be watching for shifts in the US position in the discussions on the AWG, the <span class=""highlight"">Article 9</span> review and the Dialogue session."

NORWAY expressed regret that this issue had not moved forward Â“due to the objections of a small number of countriesÂ” and noted that a COP decision had been taken on this nearly a decade ago. ARGENTINA called for urgent action on this matter, and SWITZERLAND insisted that methodological work should proceed. Chair Kumarsingh proposed, and parties agreed, to continue consideration of this matter at SBSTA 26. Following this agreement, NORWAY announced its intention to host a (non-UNFCCC) technical meeting on <span class=""highlight"">emissions</span> from aviation and <span class=""highlight"">maritime</span> <span class=""highlight"">transport</span> in October 2007.

On the latter, progress was made by separating the paragraph into two: one that explains what would be done under the programme of work, and another on the use of the deliverables. The G-77/CHINA recalled the need to address the link with SBI. The group also tabled a proposal to establish an advisory working group to facilitate, support and promote the implementation of the programme of work, with geographical representation, a balance between Annex I and non-Annex I parties, and possibly relevant international organizations."

He highlighted that climate change science requires <span class=""highlight"">emissions</span> to peak no later than 2020 and halve by 2050 in order to keep global warming below 2Â°C, and stated that the <span class=""highlight"">Kyoto Protocol</span> alone cannot achieve this. He called for a global, ambitious and comprehensive agreement in Copenhagen. He urged agreement on numbers, noting the challenge of achieving this across the two negotiating tracks.

She emphasized the economic and technical feasibility of 45% <span class=""highlight"">emission</span> reductions by 2020 and 95% reductions by 2050. She said the current Annex I pledges, amounting to 13-19% reductions below <span class=""highlight"">1990 levels</span> by 2020, are inadequate. Finally, she called on countries to muster the <span class=""highlight"">political will</span> and political skill to overcome timidity and cowardice and achieve the necessary <span class=""highlight"">emission</span> reductions."

Some wondered, however, whether the hopefulness would ultimately translate into <span class=""highlight"">political will</span> to reach a strong outcome setting the world on the track to avoid dangerous climate change. The meeting is too big to fail, commented one participant. Several others appeared to be genuinely uncertain about what Copenhagen will ultimately achieve. Some of the high-level opening statements were less ambitious than I had hoped for, lamented some parties, with others alluding to mixed signals. Many developed countries were heard talking about political declarations and COP decisions, with a possible roadmap for adopting a <span class=""highlight"">legally-binding instrument</span> later. Others, however, especially <span class=""highlight"">vulnerable</span> developing countries, continued working towards text that would result in a <span class=""highlight"">legally-binding outcome</span> to be adopted in Copenhagen."

namas|bali action plan|mrv,"MITIGATION BY DEVELOPING COUNTRIES (AWG-LCA):   In the morning informal consultations on mitigation by developing countries under sub-paragraph 1(b)(ii) of the <span class=""highlight"">BAP</span>, parties continued discussions on supported <span class=""highlight"">NAMAs</span> and focused on the <span class=""highlight"">MRV</span> section in non-paper No. 51. Many developing countries supported the first option for a title of the section that states that support for <span class=""highlight"">NAMAs</span> comes from developed countries, while some developed countries preferred a more inclusive approach, reflected in the second option. Several developed countries supported international verification of <span class=""highlight"">NAMAs</span>. Many developing countries stressed this should be conducted at the domestic level. Some developed countries, opposed by many developing countries, also supported importing text on <span class=""highlight"">MRV</span> from non-paper No. 28."
flexibility|flexibility mechanisms,"OTHER ISSUES (AWG-KP):   During morning informal consultations focusing on the <span class=""highlight"">flexibility</span> mechanisms, parties discussed how to proceed with the work of the group. Discussions focused in particular on either: continuing discussion of the issues on which consensus was not envisaged; or forwarding such issues to the COP/MOP to decide either to take no further action on the issue or to request the SBSTA to develop procedures and modalities for relevant action. Parties then considered the text ([FCCC/KP /AWG/2009/10/Add.3/Rev.3](http://unfccc.int/resource/docs/2009/awg10/eng/10a03 r03.pdf), Annex I) and identified those issues in the text that could be further considered by the group and those that could be referred to the COP/MOP."
gas|gasâ­by-gas,"In the afternoon, the group continued to meet in informal consultations to discuss the <span class=""highlight"">basket</span> of methodological issues. Parties finished working through the text and discussed the inclusion of new greenhouse <span class=""highlight"">gases</span>. Some advocated adding new <span class=""highlight"">gases</span> or species of <span class=""highlight"">gases</span>, while others emphasized that amendment of the Protocol to include new <span class=""highlight"">gases</span> was beyond the scope of the group's mandate."

The EU expressed a preference for joint conclusions. On matters relating to Protocol Article 2.3, parties discussed text on better understanding of the issues. AUSTRALIA called for a focus on the poorest and <span class=""highlight"">most vulnerable parties. Parties also consolidated options on the need to share information. On matters relating to Protocol Article 3.14, parties discussed the meaning of a phased approach and the paragraph on coordination across working groups.</span>"
gef|financial mechanism,"<span class=""highlight"">FINANCIAL MECHANISM</span> (SBI):   On the fourth review of the <span class=""highlight"">financial mechanism</span>, the EU proposed streamlining the draft conclusions (FCCC/SBI/2009/L.15/Rev.1) by deleting several preambular paragraphs. AUSTRALIA and NORWAY called for a focus on core issues. The US said its Congress was considering a request for US$ 50 million for the <span class=""highlight"">GEF</span> for various climate change activities, to be included in the 2010 budget. The contact group was then suspended following a request from the Bahamas, for the G-77/CHINA, to enable the Group to coordinate."

base year|binding commitments|reference levels,"ANNEX I <span class=""highlight"">EMISSION</span> REDUCTIONS (AWG-KP):   At the morning's contact group, Co-Chair Wollansky reported on informal consultations held on Tuesday. She identified consensus on having one single legally-binding <span class=""highlight"">base year</span> instead of multiple binding <span class=""highlight"">base years</span>. However, she said the single <span class=""highlight"">base year</span> would not necessarily be the same for all parties. She identified a lot of support for including <span class=""highlight"">reference years</span> in the Protocol amendment and said there was consensus that 1990 should be one of them."
second commitment period|kyoto protocol,"CHINA, supported by ALGERIA, BOLIVIA and VENEZUELA, emphasized the need for ambitious commitments from Annex I parties, that developed countries are supposed to lead and that they are obligated under the <span class=""highlight"">Kyoto Protocol</span> to commit to reductions in a <span class=""highlight"">second commitment period</span>."
reducing emissions|emission,"AOSIS called for increased ambition. The G/77-CHINA said that the focus of the group's mandate is on Annex I party responsibilities. CROATIA noted that some Annex I countries emit less _per capita_ than some developing countries, highlighting the inclusion of all countries in <span class=""highlight"">emission</span> reduction efforts. The EU stressed that Annex B parties represent only 30% of global <span class=""highlight"">emissions</span>."

He noted that failing to address the issues of <span class=""highlight"">AAU</span> surplus and using either current rules or unconstrained gross-net <span class=""highlight"">accounting rules</span> for <span class=""highlight"">LULUCF</span> would result in increased <span class=""highlight"">emissions</span> from the 1990 <span class=""highlight"">baseline</span>. He highlighted that even before the <span class=""highlight"">AAU</span> surplus and <span class=""highlight"">accounting rules</span>, current pledges are insufficient to achieve reductions necessary to meet the <span class=""highlight"">IPCC</span> range of a 25-40% reduction from <span class=""highlight"">1990 levels</span> by 2020."
assigned amount units,"BRAZIL requested that <span class=""highlight"">AAU</span> carryover issues be resolved separate from discussions of level of ambition. AUSTRALIA asked to see disaggregated data for the EU <span class=""highlight"">bubble</span>. AOSIS noted that 30% falls short of the level of ambition required. The EU clarified that they had used capability, responsibility, early action and population as criteria to calculate assigned amounts for individual countries."

technology|private sector|technology transfer,"<span class=""highlight"">TECHNOLOGY</span> TRANSFER (SBI/SBSTA):   During the afternoon's contact group, Co-Chair Liptow said the group's deliberations would be based on documents FCCC/SB/2009/4, Summary and INF.6, and FCCC/SBI/2009/14. He also clarified that the outcome of deliberations would be two sets of conclusions: one for the SBI and another for the SBSTA. He urged parties to focus discussions on procedural issues and defer substantive comments to future SB sessions or to <span class=""highlight"">technology</span> discussions under the AWG-LCA. The US urged increased engagement of the <span class=""highlight"">private sector</span> in <span class=""highlight"">technology</span> transfer."
performance indicators|technology|technology transfer,"India, for the G-77/CHINA, urged consideration of how to complete the report on <span class=""highlight"">performance indicators</span>. Noting that there may be substantive outcomes on <span class=""highlight"">technology</span> from Copenhagen, he suggested tailoring the EGTT's work programme to consider such outcomes. CANADA noted that the report on <span class=""highlight"">performance indicators</span> is the final report. The G-77/CHINA also called for further consideration of the <span class=""highlight"">GEF</span>'s report on implementation of the PoznaÅ„ strategic programme on <span class=""highlight"">technology</span> transfer, particularly regarding the effectiveness of the implementation. The US noted the possibility of having a further report at SB 32 on the implementation of the programme, including on <span class=""highlight"">technology</span> needs assessments and pilot projects. BANGLADESH said the report should also consider the role of implementing agencies. The Co-Chairs will prepare draft SBI and SBSTA conclusions for consideration on Thursday."
funding,"FINANCING (AWG-LCA):   The informal drafting group on finance met in the morning and afternoon, and parties continued consideration of institutional arrangements in non-paper No. 54. In the afternoon, parties discussed a diagram depicting a possible organizational structure for institutional arrangements and governance for the proposed financial architecture, aimed at helping move negotiations forward. Several parties expressed concern that the administrative layers envisaged, comprising the COP, a high-level body or executive body, the <span class=""highlight"">funds</span> and <span class=""highlight"">funding</span> windows, could prove to be burdensome and bureaucratic. Others highlighted the importance of determining the functions of the high-level board as well as the need for a monitoring function for financial commitments. A non-paper reflecting the organizational structure for institutional arrangements will be produced and informal discussions will continue."
redd|forest degradation|forest,"<span class=""highlight"">REDD</span> (SBSTA):   In the informal consultations on <span class=""highlight"">REDD</span> under SBSTA, parties continued to work through draft decision text.

technology|technology development,"<span class=""highlight"">TECHNOLOGY</span> (AWG-LCA):   The informal drafting group on <span class=""highlight"">technology</span> met in the afternoon and considered new draft text on enhanced action on <span class=""highlight"">technology</span> <span class=""highlight"">development</span> and transfer. While some delegates said that the document was useable, others said it could be shortened and expressed concern that it did not reflect the latest input from parties and the main ideas from non-paper No. 47, with elements such as the <span class=""highlight"">technology</span> mechanism lacking clear articulation. The meeting was suspended to allow for informal consultations on the way forward. Parties eventually agreed on a condensed formulation regarding the <span class=""highlight"">technology</span> mechanism consisting of an executive body or committee and a consultative network for climate <span class=""highlight"">technology</span>. A revised draft text will be produced on Thursday."
second commitment period|kyoto protocol,"The corridors were buzzing on Wednesday afternoon following an intense COP morning plenary. Tuvalu's statement calling for parties in Copenhagen to sign a new legally-binding protocol under the Convention to complement an amended <span class=""highlight"">Kyoto Protocol</span>, and to discuss this in a contact group, was the cause of the commotion. Many countries from AOSIS, Latin America and Africa were backing Tuvalu's call. However, several other developing countries, such as India and China, opposed the idea, fearing it would divert attention away from negotiations on a <span class=""highlight"">second commitment period</span> for Annex I parties under the <span class=""highlight"">Kyoto Protocol</span>. These countries stressed the need to focus on the AWG-LCA's outcome on the Convention's implementation, rather than adopting a new protocol."
ldcs,"There was also further fallout from Tuesday's leaking of the Danish text, with some delegates wondering who on the Danish side had been taking the lead, and several delegates from the South taking exception to the process as much as the substance. They should have engaged more with us, said one <span class=""highlight"">LDC</span> representative. The group that was privy to this document was too exclusive and one-sided, said another developing country delegate. Many developed countries, however, continued to play down the significance of the text, as well as the leak.  ![](http://www.iisd.ca/dailies_images/images/generic/fondoizq.gif)  ![](http://www.iisd.ca/dailies_images/images/generic/esq3.gif)  ![](http://www.iisd.ca/dailies_images/images/generic/fondoabajo.gif)  ![](http://www.iisd.ca/dailies_images/images/generic/esq4.gif)  ^ up to top  ![](http://www.iisd.ca/dailies_images/images/generic/esq1.gif)  ![](http://www.iisd.ca/dailies_images/images/generic/fondoarriba.gif)  ![](http://www.iisd.ca/dailies_images/images/generic/esq2.gif)  ![](http://www.iisd.ca/dailies_images/images/generic/fondoder.gif)  [![Back to IISD coverage](http://www.iisd.ca/dailies_images/images/generic/bac k_to_iisd.jpg)](http://www.iisd.ca/climate/cop15/)  ![](http://www.iisd.ca/dailies_images/images/generic/fondoizq.gif)  ![](http://www.iisd.ca/dailies_images/images/generic/esq3.gif)  ![](http://www.iisd.ca/dailies_images/images/generic/fondoabajo.gif)  ![](http://www.iisd.ca/dailies_images/images/generic/esq4.gif)  ![](http://www.iisd.ca/dailies_images/images/generic/esq1.gif)  ![](http://www.iisd.ca/dailies_images/images/generic/fondoarriba.gif)  ![](http://www.iisd.ca/dailies_images/images/generic/esq2.gif)  ![](http://www.iisd.ca/dailies_images/images/generic/fondoder.gif)"

The RUSSIAN FEDERATION and KYRGYZSTAN supported the proposal."
international aviation|maritime|new commitment|emission|gas|second commitment period|compliance system,"TUVALU, supported by Grenada, for AOSIS, stressed the Protocol's importance now and in the future and elaborated on its two proposals to amend the Protocol. He highlighted, _inter alia,_ proposals on: the <span class=""highlight"">second commitment period</span> and <span class=""highlight"">new commitments</span> in Annex B; extending the share of proceeds; giving legal authority to the <span class=""highlight"">Compliance Committee</span>; and including new greenhouse <span class=""highlight"">gases</span>, as well as <span class=""highlight"">international aviation</span> and <span class=""highlight"">maritime</span> <span class=""highlight"">emissions</span>."
kyoto protocol,"JAPAN outlined its proposed draft protocol, saying it relates to the Protocol's deficiencies, including that the <span class=""highlight"">Kyoto Protocol</span> only covers 30% of global <span class=""highlight"">emissions</span>. He stressed that a simple Protocol amendment would not be an effective <span class=""highlight"">post-2012</span> legal framework, expressing preference for a single new Protocol. JAPAN emphasized that the intention is not to ignore and bury the <span class=""highlight"">Kyoto Protocol</span>, but expand the scope of responsibility and construct on the Kyoto foundation an expanded and more durable vehicle."
ldcs,"Ethiopia, for <span class=""highlight"">LDCs</span>, said the issue is a controversial one as it is being discussed under both the AWG-KP and the COP/MOP. He expressed willingness to consider the issue in a contact group to see if the proposals contain ambitious targets and promote <span class=""highlight"">LDCs</span>' interests."

He said the proposal reflects the high end of the 25-40% range in the <span class=""highlight"">IPCC</span> <span class=""highlight"">AR4</span> as well as Annex I countries' <span class=""highlight"">historical responsibility</span>. Many developing countries stressed that the most important task of COP/MOP 5 is to adopt a Protocol amendment to inscribe <span class=""highlight"">new commitments</span> for developed countries in Annex B based on the mandate in Protocol Article 3.9. Many developing countries also highlighted the <span class=""highlight"">Kyoto Protocol</span> as the only <span class=""highlight"">legally-binding instrument</span> to mitigate climate change, urged continuing it in the <span class=""highlight"">second commitment period</span> and opposed attempts to kill or supersede it, or make it redundant. Many also underscored continuation of the Protocol as a condition for an outcome in Copenhagen."
binding commitments|kyoto protocol,"NEW ZEALAND said her country's preference would be a single and unified <span class=""highlight"">post-2012</span> legal outcome avoiding duplication of efforts and institutions. Without prejudice to this, she said her country has proposed Protocol amendments, envisaging the <span class=""highlight"">Kyoto Protocol</span> as part of a fully integrated package with a <span class=""highlight"">legally-binding outcome</span> under the Convention."

cdm,"<span class=""highlight"">CDM</span> (COP/MOP):   During the contact group, Co-Chair Figueres informed parties that the Co-Chairs had prepared draft decision text, based on the <span class=""highlight"">CDM</span> Executive Board (EB) report to the COP/MOP and parties' statements during the COP/MOP Plenary."
cdm,"Parties discussed the <span class=""highlight"">CDM</span> EB's study on the implications of including <span class=""highlight"">CCS</span> under the <span class=""highlight"">CDM</span>. The Secretariat provided clarification on the process by which the <span class=""highlight"">CDM</span> EB conducted the study, as requested by the COP/MOP President during the COP/MOP plenary."
cdm,"GRENADA and SAUDI ARABIA asked how the second report from the consultants tasked with conducting the study had been dealt with, with GRENADA noting that the <span class=""highlight"">CDM</span> EB did not endorse this second report. The Secretariat clarified that consultants had been requested to conduct the study, that their first report did not adequately fulfill the mandate given to them and they had been asked to prepare a second report, but the <span class=""highlight"">CDM</span> EB had been unable to make a decision on this report. He further explained that: the consultants' first report was part of the annotated agenda of the 49th meeting of the Board; the consultants' second report was part of the annotated agenda of the 50th meeting and considered during the meeting; and the main outcome of the <span class=""highlight"">CDM</span> EB's study is contained in Annex II of its report ([FCCC/KP/CMP/2009/16](http://unfccc.int/resource/docs/2009/cmp5/eng/16.pdf)).

CHINA identified the need to improve transparency, fairness and efficiency in decision-making. Ethiopia, for the <span class=""highlight"">LDCs</span>, underscored regional distribution, and proposed exempting small-scale projects in <span class=""highlight"">LDCs</span> from the <span class=""highlight"">additionality</span> requirement. He also noted that many <span class=""highlight"">LDCs</span> have unmet <span class=""highlight"">energy</span> needs and requested that this be considered for the establishment of <span class=""highlight"">baselines</span>. GRENADA and BRAZIL opposed the proposal for a full-time chair, noting the existence of a full-time Secretariat and highlighting that the proposal would only favor those countries that can afford to support a full-time chair. GRENADA also objected to adopting terms of reference for <span class=""highlight"">CDM</span> EB members, highlighting that it may bias countries with limited <span class=""highlight"">CDM</span> knowledge and expertise. SAUDI ARABIA supported consideration of terms of reference."

Some parties also questioned the appropriateness of discussing the issue of <span class=""highlight"">hydrofluorocarbons</span> (<span class=""highlight"">HFCs</span>). Most parties urged continuing discussions in a smaller drafting group in order to facilitate the work."
bali action plan,"FINANCE AND MITIGATION (AWG-LCA):   Joint informal consultations were held between the drafting group on finance and the group on sub-paragraph 1(b) (ii) of the <span class=""highlight"">BAP</span> on mitigation by developing countries. The aim of the joint consultations was to discuss placement of issues being considered under both groups with a view to avoiding duplication."
namas|bali action plan,"Delegates began by addressing a section on support for <span class=""highlight"">NAMAs</span> reflected in non-paper No. 51 on sub-paragraph 1(b)(ii) of the <span class=""highlight"">BAP</span>. Several parties advocated moving all paragraphs containing financial provisions to the finance group. Others maintained that text on new and additional support should remain under consideration by the mitigation drafting group. The need to consider the what and how of support and reach agreement on principles regarding what is specific to <span class=""highlight"">NAMAs</span> and their implementation were also raised. Parties agreed to place markers on text to be considered by the finance group."
namas|bali action plan,"Delegates then addressed modalities for matching action and support through a mechanism to register or record and facilitate implementation of <span class=""highlight"">NAMAs</span>. Some parties preferred to house a matching function or registry within a <span class=""highlight"">financial mechanism</span>, while others said that matching functions should remain within the purview of the drafting group on sub- paragraph 1(b)(ii) of the <span class=""highlight"">BAP</span>. Informal discussions among several parties will continue on the matching function."

She noted that there are many ways to address <span class=""highlight"">AAUs</span>, including requesting parties not to use them in the <span class=""highlight"">second commitment period</span>, capping carryovers, and discounting. NEW ZEALAND suggested using actual <span class=""highlight"">emissions</span> as a starting point for calculating <span class=""highlight"">quantified emission limitation and reduction objectives</span> (<span class=""highlight"">QELROs</span>) as a means of eliminating surplus <span class=""highlight"">AAUs</span>.

He explained that in the interim, the AFB would effectuate direct access by entering into MoUs. Parties then endorsed all the matters under consideration. A draft decision will be prepared for approval by the COP/MOP."

They focused discussions on <span class=""highlight"">reference levels</span>, in particular, on whether and how to include national and/or sub-national <span class=""highlight"">reference levels</span>. On establishing monitoring systems, some parties suggested that only activities that are supported financially would be open to review, while others said that these considerations are political. Parties also discussed a proposal for text on capacity building to enhance coordination on <span class=""highlight"">REDD</span> and agreed to work on developing consensus language.

bali action plan,"On the AWG-LCA text, several parties welcomed the text as a basis for continuing work under the group. However, some expressed surprise at the timing of its release and what they characterized as lack of adequate consultation with the smaller negotiating groups. While the AWG-LCA Chair stressed that the text does not prejudge the legal form of the outcome, the proposal envisages the AWG-LCA's outcome as a package consisting of a possible core COP decision, complemented by thematic decisions on the main elements of the <span class=""highlight"">BAP</span>. Those calling for a <span class=""highlight"">legally-binding outcome</span> in Copenhagen continued stressing their position, while many others seemed willing to accept an outcome based on a COP decision, at least as a short-term solution."
uncertainties,"Throughout the day, parties studied the details of the AWG- LCA draft in preparation for further informal consultations on the substance in the evening. Apparently, many of them found various issues that they characterized as seriously problematic, with some highlighting <span class=""highlight"">uncertainty</span> over future steps to reach a <span class=""highlight"">legally-binding outcome</span> and others stressing the text on mitigation as an unacceptable basis for discussions."

Taking the lead from UNFCCC Executive Secretary Yvo de Boer's briefing Friday morning, approximately 400 <span class=""highlight"">business</span> representatives discussed ways that the <span class=""highlight"">private sector</span> could contribute to quick-start activities. Existing sectoral initiatives, including for cement, were highlighted as areas in which the <span class=""highlight"">business</span> community could contribute immediate action. <span class=""highlight"">Business</span> leaders also emphasized the desirability of a stable, long-term government-led framework on climate change, as many highlighted that <span class=""highlight"">business</span> cannot take the lead towards a <span class=""highlight"">low-carbon</span> economy without a price being set on carbon.  ![](http://www.iisd.ca/dailies_images/images/generic/fondoizq.gif)  ![](http://www.iisd.ca/dailies_images/images/generic/esq3.gif)  ![](http://www.iisd.ca/dailies_images/images/generic/fondoabajo.gif)  ![](http://www.iisd.ca/dailies_images/images/generic/esq4.gif)  ^ up to top  ![](http://www.iisd.ca/dailies_images/images/generic/esq1.gif)  ![](http://www.iisd.ca/dailies_images/images/generic/fondoarriba.gif)  ![](http://www.iisd.ca/dailies_images/images/generic/esq2.gif)  ![](http://www.iisd.ca/dailies_images/images/generic/fondoder.gif)  [![Back to IISD coverage](http://www.iisd.ca/dailies_images/images/generic/bac k_to_iisd.jpg)](http://www.iisd.ca/climate/cop15/)  ![](http://www.iisd.ca/dailies_images/images/generic/fondoizq.gif)  ![](http://www.iisd.ca/dailies_images/images/generic/esq3.gif)  ![](http://www.iisd.ca/dailies_images/images/generic/fondoabajo.gif)  ![](http://www.iisd.ca/dailies_images/images/generic/esq4.gif)  ![](http://www.iisd.ca/dailies_images/images/generic/esq1.gif)  ![](http://www.iisd.ca/dailies_images/images/generic/fondoarriba.gif)  ![](http://www.iisd.ca/dailies_images/images/generic/esq2.gif)  ![](http://www.iisd.ca/dailies_images/images/generic/fondoder.gif)"

He said he had tabled a text on Friday on the AWG-LCA's outcome and noted parties' divergent views on the legal form, including whether to have two legal instruments or one. He said this highly important subject goes beyond the scope of one negotiating group and suggested that the COP President keep an eye on the issue."
forestry,"The US commended the Chair's heroic work in incorporating core issues into a concise document and noted progress in many areas, such as <span class=""highlight"">technology</span>, <span class=""highlight"">forestry</span> and adaptation. He identified, however, the need to clarify how to move forward with the difficult and core questions in a way that will have an immediate operational effect, saying ministerial negotiations could bring the necessary sense of urgency to these discussions."

He reiterated that the outcome should build on the <span class=""highlight"">Kyoto Protocol</span>, taking forward its key elements. He called for a political agreement that is precise and comprehensive enough to be transformed into a legally- <span class=""highlight"">binding agreemen</span>t."

TUVALU stressed that their aim was not to merge the <span class=""highlight"">Kyoto Protocol</span> with a new instrument but to preserve the legal architecture including the Protocol. Calling for substantive discussions, he said it would be grave injustice to forward the issue to another COP/MOP. Highlighting focus on the adoption of deep <span class=""highlight"">emission</span> reductions by Annex I parties and that many aspects of the amendment proposal are inconsistent with the Convention, INDIA called for proceeding with work without sidestepping.

The EU, supported by NORWAY, proposed having an option stating that no decision should be taken on this issue. GRENADA proposed inserting a preamble recognizing that developed countries shall achieve their <span class=""highlight"">QELROs</span> primarily through domestic efforts."
funding,"FINANCE (AWG-LCA):   Delegates considered a co- facilitators' text on institutional arrangements reflecting common elements on issues including: a body, <span class=""highlight"">fund</span> or entity; existing <span class=""highlight"">funds</span> and entities; and issues for consideration by COP 16. Discussions continued late into the evening."
shared vision,"<span class=""highlight"">SHARED VISION</span> (AWG-LCA):   Informal consultations were held in the evening, where parties continued paragraph-by-paragraph discussions of the draft text, focusing, _inter alia,_ on the review of a <span class=""highlight"">shared vision</span>."
ldcs,"In the negotiations, substantive work on the long-term issues was suspended until late afternoon, pending consultations by the COP President on how to proceed. The need for such consultations arose due to deadlock between developing and developed countries: the African Group and <span class=""highlight"">LDCs</span>, supported by the G-77/China, requested suspending all negotiations under the AWG-LCA. The move was repeated under the AWG-KP in all negotiating groups apart from the one focusing on Annex I parties' further <span class=""highlight"">emission</span> reductions. The EU, Australia and other developed countries participating in the AWG-KP, in turn, found this unacceptable."
funding|adaptation fund,"On Tuesday evening, the welcoming ceremony of the high-level segment took place. Late in the evening, the AWG-KP closing plenary convened. The AWG-LCA held its closing meeting early on Wednesday morning. Throughout the day on Tuesday, contact groups and informal consultations were held on a range of issues, including <span class=""highlight"">potential consequences</span> and other issues under the AWG-KP, long-term <span class=""highlight"">cooperative action</span> under the AWG-LCA and the Adaptation <span class=""highlight"">Fund</span> Board under the COP/MOP."

He called for a fair, ambitious and comprehensive agreement, specifying that this means: more ambitious mid-term mitigation targets from industrialized countries; more action by developing countries to limit <span class=""highlight"">emissions</span> growth below <span class=""highlight"">business</span> as usual; an adaptation framework for all countries; financing and <span class=""highlight"">technology</span> support; and transparent and equitable governance. He stressed financing as a key, welcoming the emerging consensus among developed countries to provide approximately US$10 billion annually for the next three years to the Copenhagen Launch <span class=""highlight"">Fund</span>. UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon underlined that the goal is to lay the foundation for a legally- binding climate treaty as early as possible in 2010, and said that until such an agreement is reached the <span class=""highlight"">Kyoto Protocol</span> remains the only <span class=""highlight"">legally-binding instrument</span> that captures <span class=""highlight"">reduction commitments</span> and that as such it must be maintained."
mitigation actions|redd|bali action plan,"UNFCCC Executive Secretary Yvo de Boer noted that Tuesday was the second anniversary of the adoption of the <span class=""highlight"">Bali Roadmap</span> and stressed that now it is time to deliver. He said there had been some progress but not nearly enough to celebrate success. He noted that groundwork has been laid for prompt implementation of <span class=""highlight"">action on mitigation</span>, adaptation, <span class=""highlight"">technology</span> cooperation, finance, <span class=""highlight"">REDD</span> and capacity building. Highlighting that 115 world leaders are not coming to Copenhagen to leave empty handed, he called on parties to resolve outstanding issues."
forest|business,"His Royal Highness Charles, the Prince of Wales, stressed that a partial solution to climate change is no solution at all. He underscored the benefit of partnerships between government, <span class=""highlight"">business</span>, NGOs and civil society, and said the quickest and most cost-effective way to address climate change is to protect tropical <span class=""highlight"">forests</span>."
eit|economies in transition,"Chair Zammit Cutajar identified the core decision (FCCC/AWGLCA/2009/L.7) as some of the less mature elements of the package. He explained that a preambular paragraph had been added during the day on special circumstances by countries with <span class=""highlight"">economies in transition</span>."
shared vision|ldcs,"ALGERIA requested going through all the decisions included in the package one-by-one. Many parties then expressed their concern with the texts and provided detailed proposals for changes, focusing first on document FCCC/AWGLCA/2009/L7. Sudan, for the G-77/CHINA, suggested bracketing text in the section on finance, in particular with regard to developed country pledges for short-term financing. Bangladesh, for <span class=""highlight"">LDCs</span>, with the UNITED REPUBLIC OF TANZANIA and the Cook Islands, for AOSIS, proposed a reference to special concerns of <span class=""highlight"">LDCs</span>, <span class=""highlight"">SIDS</span> and African countries in the text on adaptation. NORWAY and MEXICO noted that their proposals on financing arrangements should be reflected in full. BOLIVIA noted, _inter alia,_ her country's textual proposals on a <span class=""highlight"">shared vision</span> and indigenous peoples. JAPAN noted strong concerns on, _inter alia_, mitigation and legal outcome. The EU stressed the need to convey their concerns to the COP President on issues including on a <span class=""highlight"">legally binding</span> outcome and mitigation."
gasâ­by-gas|emissions inventories|gas|flexibility mechanisms|flexibility,"Vice-Chair Dovland reported on the work of the other issues group. On the <span class=""highlight"">basket</span> of methodological issues, he noted agreement on the 2006 <span class=""highlight"">IPCC</span> Guidelines for National <span class=""highlight"">Greenhouse Gas Inventories</span>, cleaner text on common metrics, but lack of agreement on including new greenhouse <span class=""highlight"">gases</span>. On the <span class=""highlight"">flexibility</span> mechanisms, he reported inability to clean up all the text."
compliance system,"On the contact group on <span class=""highlight"">potential consequences</span>, Co-Chair Ure identified three remaining areas of disagreement: defining countries for whom <span class=""highlight"">potential consequences</span> will be most severe; guidelines for reporting; and establishing a permanent forum, using the <span class=""highlight"">Compliance Committee</span> and/or national communications to address <span class=""highlight"">potential consequences</span>."

Chair Zammit Cutajar then briefly explained the core decision text and the thematic texts."
funding,"Co-Facilitator Uosukainen introduced the co-facilitators' new text on finance. He said the text attempts to capture the essence of the discussions on <span class=""highlight"">financial institutions</span>, noting text on a possible high-level finance committee to assist the COP and a climate <span class=""highlight"">fund</span> or facility."
bali action plan|ldcs,"BANGLADESH called for mention of special treatment of <span class=""highlight"">LDCs</span> and <span class=""highlight"">SIDS</span> as set out under the Convention and <span class=""highlight"">BAP</span>. He said that a Copenhagen outcome should also include an international adaptation center, regional centers and an adaptation window under the Convention. SINGAPORE said that the text contained proposals that were not acceptable to his delegation."
post-2012|market mechanisms|market approaches,"The EU questioned why a timeframe for concluding a legally- <span class=""highlight"">binding agreemen</span>t had been omitted from the text, stressing that while immediate action must be taken, the intention is not to establish piecemeal mechanisms here and there but to frame the institutions and the <span class=""highlight"">post-2012</span> architecture in a <span class=""highlight"">legally-binding instrument</span> as soon as possible in 2010. Chair Zammit Cutajar noted the importance of considering timelines for further work. The EU, with AUSTRALIA, also stressed the need to have text on <span class=""highlight"">market approaches</span>, identifying new <span class=""highlight"">market mechanisms</span> as a core issue. Chair Zammit Cutajar explained that such text had been left out due to an intended informal ministerial consultation, but that it would be included."
ldcs|reducing emissions|emission|gas|stabilization,"BARBADOS lamented the unequal way of dealing with controversial issues, noting that the text contained reference to response measures while no references to <span class=""highlight"">LDCs</span> and <span class=""highlight"">SIDS</span> were included. He also stressed the importance of a global long-term goal for <span class=""highlight"">emission</span> reductions and greenhouse <span class=""highlight"">gas</span> concentration <span class=""highlight"">stabilization</span> levels being discussed at the ministerial level. He noted his intention to take up the question of legal form of the outcome in plenary."

bali action plan,"Highlighting sub-paragraphs 1(b)(i) and 1(b)(ii) of the <span class=""highlight"">BAP</span> on mitigation by developed and developing countries, BRAZIL, supported by CHINA, stressed the need for a balanced consideration of issues. He lamented that ministerial meetings on mitigation by developing countries have been scheduled while no progress has been made on mitigation by developed countries. CHINA underscored that ministerial discussions must be transparent and balanced in terms of the subjects discussed."
hydrofluorocarbons|hfcs,"Chair Zammit Cutajar said he would consult parties informally in the afternoon to identify issues where substantive progress could still be made, such as adaptation and <span class=""highlight"">hydrofluorocarbons</span>. He recognized that various parties had concerns with the text but noted that we have had two years and must finish today. He said he was disappointed at the state of the texts and explained that due to the number of outstanding issues, it would not possible for him to try to clean up the text with parties. Chair Zammit Cutajar said the alternatives were to consult informally in the afternoon on issues where progress could still be made or forward the texts to the COP as they stand. He also reminded parties that they can take up their concerns at the COP plenary."

supplementarity|domestic action|flexibility|flexibility mechanisms,"AUSTRALIA, supported by CANADA, proposed moving the preambular text on the mechanisms being supplementary to <span class=""highlight"">domestic action</span> to the operative part and then inserting an option maintaining the _status quo_. Grenada, for AOSIS, JAMAICA, PERU and BRAZIL, opposed by NORWAY and SAUDI ARABIA, supported retaining the text in the preamble. NEW ZEALAND proposed inserting alternative language in the preamble, recalling the definition of <span class=""highlight"">supplementarity</span> in decision 2/CMP.1 (principles, nature and scope of the <span class=""highlight"">flexibility</span> mechanisms). On the <span class=""highlight"">supplementarity</span> section of the text, BRAZIL, supported by PERU and opposed by JAPAN and SAUDI ARABIA, proposed specifying a cap of 30% on the use of the <span class=""highlight"">flexibility</span> mechanisms."

GRENADA, supported by PERU and the EU, and opposed by UGANDA, preferred deleting the paragraph exempting <span class=""highlight"">SIDS</span> from payment of fees and retaining the option permitting postponement of the payment of fees by parties with fewer than ten registered projects, noting that exempting all countries with fewer than ten projects could negatively impact functioning of the <span class=""highlight"">CDM</span> Executive Board. JAPAN and CANADA noted the need to specify that the payment would be postponed until the first issuance of <span class=""highlight"">Certified Emission Reductions</span> (<span class=""highlight"">CERs</span>)."
cdm projects|cdm|cers,"On the paragraph on establishing a quota, CANADA, supported by JAPAN, opposed identifying a specific percentage of <span class=""highlight"">CERs</span> to come from countries with fewer than ten <span class=""highlight"">CDM</span> projects, and JAPAN preferred language encouraging parties rather than deciding to use <span class=""highlight"">CERs</span> coming from these countries. ETHIOPIA, supported by MALI, noted that the language already reflects compromise and preferred retaining the text as it stands. ETHIOPIA, opposed by many countries, but supported by UGANDA, proposed that this quota should apply to countries that had fewer than ten projects in the first commitment period. NEW ZEALAND proposed having the paragraphs in this section as a menu of options from which ministers could choose one or more paragraphs. Vice-Chair Dovland noted that this was the last meeting of the contact group and that discussions would continue within the context of the report of the AWG-KP to the COP/MOP."
namas|reducing emissions|emission,"During the day, some delegates, who were rushing between contact groups, informal ministerial consultations and informal expert-level consultations, complained that it was extremely hard to keep track of what was going on. The COP President's open-ended informal consultations in the afternoon seemed to provide some assistance, as parties heard reports on discussions during the informal ministerial consultations. On finance, for instance, it was reported that the issue of numbers for <span class=""highlight"">long-term financing</span>, the scale of contributions and the countries that should contribute continued to cause disagreement. On a long-term <span class=""highlight"">emission</span> reduction goal, consultations reportedly centered on issues such as the level of limiting global average temperature increase, whether 1.5 or 2Â°C. Under developing country mitigation, differences persisted, _inter alia_, on the nature, definition and scope of <span class=""highlight"">NAMAs</span>. Ministerials on developed country <span class=""highlight"">emission</span> reductions under the AWG-KP reportedly attempted to discuss how to raise the level of ambition of Annex I targets, but well-known differences persisted and not much progress was made."

Parties were able to reach agreement on most paragraphs except those relating to: the prerogative of the host country to decide on incentive policies; conflicts of interest of Board members; the <span class=""highlight"">development</span> of standardized <span class=""highlight"">baselines</span>; the definition of <span class=""highlight"">forests</span> in exhaustion; including <span class=""highlight"">CCS</span> under the <span class=""highlight"">CDM</span>; and providing loans to countries with fewer than ten registered projects."
climate justice,"As the AWG-LCA was winding up its closing plenary just before 7:00 am, other delegates began returning to work. At the same time, police had surround the area in anticipation of protests and possible attempts by demonstrators to take over the Bella Center. Indeed, violent clashes outside the Center between demonstrators and police punctuated the morning. Inside the building, two individuals also jumped on to the podium during one of the high-level national statements, calling for <span class=""highlight"">climate justice</span> before detonating a sound bomb."

Inside the plenary, many developing countries voiced their objection to the planned procedure. In the corridors, many were outraged at what they described as an attempt to sideline the work done by the AWGs. What is going on? What are they doing? despaired one veteran negotiator. Tense backroom discussions were reportedly occurring behind the scenes during the day to determine how to proceed. However, most delegates, even many well-known negotiators, appeared to be unaware of the exact details of these consultations. This has been an extraordinary day in the UNFCCC negotiations. My best advice is for us all to have a good night's sleep tonight so that we can come back tomorrow with renewed <span class=""highlight"">energy</span> needed to complete our work, remarked COP Vice-President Figueres Olsen as she wrapped up the COP's evening plenary.  ![](http://www.iisd.ca/dailies_images/images/generic/fondoizq.gif)  ![](http://www.iisd.ca/dailies_images/images/generic/esq3.gif)  ![](http://www.iisd.ca/dailies_images/images/generic/fondoabajo.gif)  ![](http://www.iisd.ca/dailies_images/images/generic/esq4.gif)  ^ up to top  ![](http://www.iisd.ca/dailies_images/images/generic/esq1.gif)  ![](http://www.iisd.ca/dailies_images/images/generic/fondoarriba.gif)  ![](http://www.iisd.ca/dailies_images/images/generic/esq2.gif)  ![](http://www.iisd.ca/dailies_images/images/generic/fondoder.gif)  [![Back to IISD coverage](http://www.iisd.ca/dailies_images/images/generic/bac k_to_iisd.jpg)](http://www.iisd.ca/climate/cop15/)  ![](http://www.iisd.ca/dailies_images/images/generic/fondoizq.gif)  ![](http://www.iisd.ca/dailies_images/images/generic/esq3.gif)  ![](http://www.iisd.ca/dailies_images/images/generic/fondoabajo.gif)  ![](http://www.iisd.ca/dailies_images/images/generic/esq4.gif)  ![](http://www.iisd.ca/dailies_images/images/generic/esq1.gif)  ![](http://www.iisd.ca/dailies_images/images/generic/fondoarriba.gif)  ![](http://www.iisd.ca/dailies_images/images/generic/esq2.gif)  ![](http://www.iisd.ca/dailies_images/images/generic/fondoder.gif)"

He identified issues requiring political attention: addressing surplus <span class=""highlight"">AAUs</span>; the question of how to populate Annex B with <span class=""highlight"">QELROs</span>, or in the absence of agreement on a Protocol amendment in Copenhagen, how to reflect pledges moving forward; and a core decision defining further work if it were to continue due to lack of agreement at this time."

bunker fuels,"NORWAY and ARGENTINA inquired about addressing <span class=""highlight"">emissions</span> from <span class=""highlight"">bunker fuels</span> and COP President's Special Representative Hedegaard explained that text would be available in the afternoon. SAUDI ARABIA also drew attention to the issue of <span class=""highlight"">bunker fuels</span>, saying this had not been captured as a supplementary decision to the core decision. He also asked how response measures would be addressed. COP President's Special Representative Hedegaard confirmed that a facilitator was being sought for the group on response measures."
sectoral approaches|agriculture,"On <span class=""highlight"">sectoral approaches</span>, EGYPT noted long discussions on guiding principles and asked for the reinsertion of principles in the text. URUGUAY called for the establishment of a drafting group on <span class=""highlight"">sectoral approaches</span> in the <span class=""highlight"">agriculture</span> sector."
eit|economies in transition,"SOUTH AFRICA stressed that capacity building is for developing countries and highlighted that it would be difficult to discuss capacity building for developed countries in text concerning developing countries. Tanzania, for the G-77/CHINA, called for separate discussions on capacity building for developing countries and countries with <span class=""highlight"">economies in transition</span>. The RUSSIAN FEDERATION suggested that a compromise proposal should be sought to resolve the issue."
technology|intellectual property rights,"On <span class=""highlight"">technology</span>, Co-Facilitator Kumarsingh reported that parties have agreed on the establishment of a <span class=""highlight"">technology</span> mechanism with a <span class=""highlight"">technology</span> executive committee and a climate executive center. He said discussions had focused on the functions of these entities and agreement had been reached with some minor issues outstanding. Kumarsingh identified issues in need of ministerial intervention as: the reporting line between the committee and center; link between the committee and agreement on finance; and the issue of <span class=""highlight"">intellectual property rights</span>."
cooperative action|shared vision|human rights,"On a <span class=""highlight"">shared vision</span> for long-term <span class=""highlight"">cooperative action</span>, Facilitator Zammit Cutajar observed that views had been expressed on <span class=""highlight"">human rights</span>, stakeholder participation and a just transition to a new form of production and <span class=""highlight"">consumption</span>, which could be addressed through further discussion. He noted discussions on the concept of long-term goals, on finance, <span class=""highlight"">technology</span> and adaptation, in addition to the long-term global goal on <span class=""highlight"">emission</span> reductions. Facilitator Zammit Cutajar also identified the need to resolve the issue of review, especially in terms of what is to be reviewed."
namas,"On a possible <span class=""highlight"">NAMA</span> registry or mechanism, Facilitator Mukahanana-Sangarwe said no agreement had been reached on the establishment of a <span class=""highlight"">NAMA</span> registry or mechanism, the functions of such a registry or mechanisms, and on whether the registry should be independent of, or part of the financialmechanism. Facilitator Mukahanana-Sangarwe said divergent views remained on whether support for <span class=""highlight"">NAMAs</span> should come only from developed countries or from both developed and developing countries and identified treatment of autonomous <span class=""highlight"">NAMAs</span> as issues in need of political resolution."
funding,"Reporting on financial institutional arrangements, Co- Facilitator Uosukainen said that the drafting group had addressed the issue of a climate <span class=""highlight"">fund</span> or facility, and noted movement on the selection of a trustee to the <span class=""highlight"">fund</span> or facility on an interim basis. He said that divergent views remained on the composition and nomination of a finance board and its corresponding functions, explaining that these issues could benefit from political resolution. Facilitator Uosukainen also noted that the group lacked time to address the remaining paragraphs on the establishment and functions of the proposed finance board."
mitigation actions|montreal protocol|ozone|hydrofluorocarbons,"On various approaches to enhancing cost-effectiveness of <span class=""highlight"">mitigation actions</span>, including markets, Facilitator Figueres Olsen highlighted two outstanding issues: whether to adopt an option encouraging parties to pursue <span class=""highlight"">HFC</span> regulation under the <span class=""highlight"">Montreal Protocol</span> on Substances that Deplete the <span class=""highlight"">Ozone</span> Layer; and the role of markets and how this role should be structured."
vulnerable,"VENEZUELA, with Angola, for the AFRICAN GROUP, drew attention to the option of not taking any decision on <span class=""highlight"">market approaches</span>, while the US stressed the centrality of <span class=""highlight"">market approaches</span>. PAKISTAN inquired on the issue of <span class=""highlight"">vulnerability</span> in the adaptation text, to which Co-Facilitator Kolly noted that this topic has not been discussed yet and might go to a higher level of discussion."
ldcs,"Bangladesh, for the <span class=""highlight"">LDCs</span>, said drafting groups could report back in the morning and issues could then be forwarded to the political level. MEXICO supported working in a friends of the chair format, provided the group discusses only political issues. NEW ZEALAND stressed the need to continue working through a smaller group with higher-level representation."
funding|adaptation fund,"<span class=""highlight"">JOINT IMPLEMENTATION</span> (COP/MOP):   During the contact group on <span class=""highlight"">joint implementation</span> (<span class=""highlight"">JI</span>), Co-Chair Lesolle introduced a revised draft COP/MOP decision, noting that the only outstanding issue is that relating to extending the share of proceeds to <span class=""highlight"">JI</span>.  SIERRA LEONE noted the new text does not adequately reflect previous discussions, especially regarding the option to take no decision on the issue, and also regarding reference to double counting. He also proposed specifying that the share of proceeds will be paid into the Adaptation <span class=""highlight"">Fund</span>. The RUSSIAN FEDERATION, supported by UKRAINE, proposed a new option, which states that the share of proceeds would be paid into the Adaptation <span class=""highlight"">Fund</span> on a voluntary basis. NEW ZEALAND said the option of taking no decision on the issue is misleading and proposed amending the option to state that no decision would be taken on the issue within this contact group, noting that this issue was being discussed elsewhere and a decision could be taken there. UKRAINE said they would be willing to drop the third option on payment on a voluntary basis, if the first option regarding no decision to be taken is kept in its original form without the new insertions regarding decisions being possibly taken elsewhere. The Co-Chairs will consult informally and produce new text for Friday."
mrv,"Indeed, some softening of positions and progress could finally be detected from the statements by high-level representatives on Thursday. At her press conference in the morning, US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton announced that the US is prepared to work with other countries to mobilize US$100 billion a year by 2020. A financing announcement had also been made earlier by Japan to raise climate aid to about US$15 billion by 2012. In his plenary statement, French President Sarkozy also stressed the need for financing for developing countries and remarked that if keeping the <span class=""highlight"">Kyoto Protocol</span> is what it takes, then the <span class=""highlight"">Kyoto Protocol</span> could be retained. Reports on softening in China's position concerning <span class=""highlight"">MRV</span> were also circulating. Many were hoping these announcements would have a positive impact on the negotiations.  Negotiators were prepared for a long and sleepless night, as the COP and COP/MOP contact groups decided to continue working well beyond midnight. Rumors were also circulating that the world leaders were making their own efforts to work towards a deal. One way or another Friday is going to be a historic day in this process, and the whole world is pushing for us in this building to make it a resounding success."

These countries, known as Annex I parties under the UNFCCC, agreed to reduce their overall <span class=""highlight"">emissions</span> of six greenhouse <span class=""highlight"">gases</span> by an average of 5.2% below <span class=""highlight"">1990 levels</span> between 2008-2012 (the first commitment period), with specific targets varying from country to country. The <span class=""highlight"">Kyoto Protocol</span> entered into force on 16 February 2005 and now has 192 parties."

In addition, COP 11 agreed in Montreal to consider <span class=""highlight"">long-term cooperation</span> under the Convention through a series of four workshops known as the Convention Dialogue, which continued until COP 13."

Negotiations resulted in the adoption of the <span class=""highlight"">Bali Action Plan</span> (<span class=""highlight"">BAP</span>), which established the _Ad Hoc _Working Group on Long- term <span class=""highlight"">Cooperative Action</span> under the Convention with a mandate to focus on key elements of <span class=""highlight"">long-term cooperation</span> identified during the Convention Dialogue: mitigation, adaptation, finance and <span class=""highlight"">technology</span> transfer. The Bali conference also resulted in agreement on a two-year process, the <span class=""highlight"">Bali Roadmap</span>, which established two negotiating tracks under the Convention and the Protocol, and set a deadline for concluding the negotiations at COP 15 and COP/MOP 5 in Copenhagen in December 2009."
bali action plan,"AWG-LCA:   For the AWG-LCA, the first part of 2009 focused on developing draft negotiating text. This process resulted in a text that was nearly 200 pages long and covered all the main elements of the <span class=""highlight"">BAP</span>. Because of the length of the text, delegates began producing non-papers, reading guides, tables and matrices aimed at making the negotiating text more manageable. The outcome was a series of non-papers, forwarded to Copenhagen as an annex to the meeting report. Heading into Copenhagen, many felt the AWG-LCA had made satisfactory progress on adaptation, <span class=""highlight"">technology</span> and capacity building, but that deep divides remained on mitigation and certain aspects of finance."
reducing emissions|emission|land-use change|land use|forestry|lulucf|flexibility mechanisms|kyoto protocol|flexibility,"AWG-KP:   For the AWG-KP, the focus in 2009 was on the numbers, namely Annex I parties' aggregate and individual <span class=""highlight"">emission</span> reductions beyond 2012, when the Protocol's first commitment period expires. Parties also discussed other issues in the AWG-KP's work programme, including the <span class=""highlight"">flexibility</span> mechanisms, <span class=""highlight"">land use</span>, <span class=""highlight"">land-use</span> change and <span class=""highlight"">forestry</span> (<span class=""highlight"">LULUCF</span>) and <span class=""highlight"">potential consequences</span> of response measures. The discussions were based on documentation divided into proposals for amendments to the Protocol under Article 3.9 and text on other issues, such as <span class=""highlight"">LULUCF</span> and the <span class=""highlight"">flexibility</span> mechanisms. Ahead of Copenhagen, many felt that insufficient progress had been made on Annex I parties' aggregate and individual <span class=""highlight"">emission</span> reductions, and differences also surfaced between developed and developing countries concerning whether the outcome from Copenhagen should be an amendment to the <span class=""highlight"">Kyoto Protocol</span> or a single new agreement bringing together the work done by the two AWGs."
mitigation actions,"The conference was marked by disputes over transparency and process. During the high-level segment, informal negotiations took place in a group consisting of major economies and representatives of regional and other negotiating groups. Late in the evening of 18 December, these talks resulted in a political agreement: the <span class=""highlight"">Copenhagen Accord</span>, which was then brought to the COP plenary. Over the next 13 hours, delegates debated the Accord. Many supported adopting it in the form of a COP decision as a step towards securing a better future agreement. However, some developing countries opposed the Accord, which they felt had been reached through an untransparent and undemocratic process. Ultimately, the COP agreed to take note of the <span class=""highlight"">Copenhagen Accord</span>. They also established a process for parties to indicate their support for the Accord and, to date, 140 countries have indicated their support. More than 80 countries have also provided information on their <span class=""highlight"">emission</span> reduction targets and other <span class=""highlight"">mitigation actions</span>."

Outlining his country's proposal for a new protocol that supplements the <span class=""highlight"">Kyoto Protocol</span>, TUVALU highlighted the contact group as a step toward the adoption of a <span class=""highlight"">legally-binding instrument</span> in Durban. COSTA RICA emphasized that the group should have the mandate to clarify the legal form."
binding commitments|kyoto protocol,"CHINA acknowledged the importance of discussing legal issues, saying that an amendment to Protocol Annex B constitutes a legally- binding outcome under the Protocol track, and that a <span class=""highlight"">legally-binding outcome</span> to strengthen the Convention's implementation is acceptable for his country. Supported by SAUDI ARABIA, CHINA stressed parties' considerable workload and urged focusing on the two AWGs and on a constructive and balanced outcome in Cancun. SAUDI ARABIA underlined the threat to the continuity of the <span class=""highlight"">Kyoto Protocol</span> given that some parties have stated that under no circumstances will they accept a <span class=""highlight"">new commitment</span> period."
uncertainties,"SOUTH AFRICA identified <span class=""highlight"">uncertainty</span> over legal form as a major obstacle to the negotiations and said decision on this issue will unblock many issues. She called for a pragmatic approach, noting that the work by the COP, COP/MOP and the two AWGs must be complementary and mutually supportive. SOUTH AFRICA identified the need to advance work under the Convention and the Protocol in a balanced and comprehensive manner to achieve outcomes with the same legal status."
binding commitments,"AUSTRALIA welcomed parties' interest in a <span class=""highlight"">legally-binding outcome</span> and, noting her country's efforts to advance such discussions, supported a robust discussion bringing together all related proposals. NORWAY expressed strong support for a <span class=""highlight"">legally-binding outcome</span>, called for sufficient time to discuss it and supported Grenada's proposal."

He urged parties to rebuild trust, demonstrate leadership and adopt a legally-binding framework to safeguard the <span class=""highlight"">most vulnerable countries that are least responsible for the climate problem. The CLIMATE ACTION NETWORK stressed that parties have the opportunity today to establish a process to make a substantial contribution towards a legally- binding outcome. CLIMATE JUSTICE NOW requested parties to work towards a just outcome on two tracks, bearing in mind historical responsibility, and for developed countries to reduce emissions by 40% without the use of markets or other assistance. INDIGENOUS PEOPLES' ORGANIZATIONS stressed the dire and urgent situation of indigenous peoples facing climate impacts.</span>"

On the addition of new GHGs where the source of <span class=""highlight"">emissions</span> is poorly understood, parties discussed options for reporting on, but not accounting for these <span class=""highlight"">gases</span> due to the challenge of attribution. Some parties underscored the need for more technical work on these issues.

uncertainties|binding commitments|kyoto protocol,"During the plenaries, dedicated to the proposed new protocols under the Convention and various proposals to amend the <span class=""highlight"">Kyoto Protocol</span>, delegates' intense interest was hardly surprising given that <span class=""highlight"">uncertainty</span> over the legal form of the AWG-LCA's outcome has cast its shadow over the negotiations since COP 13 in Bali, and that the <span class=""highlight"">Kyoto Protocol</span>'s future seems to be hanging in balance. Many of those having witnessed the COP's acrimonious discussions on the proposed new protocols in Copenhagen last year were positively surprised by the session. Parties agreed to the <span class=""highlight"">AOSIS proposal</span> to establish a contact group on the legal outcome without any debate or dissent. Some also observed that positions of key G-77/China countries had shifted towards openly supporting a <span class=""highlight"">legally-binding outcome</span> under the AWG-LCA. This is definitely a positive step towards the right direction - but we may still have different views on what a <span class=""highlight"">legally binding</span> outcome means, analyzed one seasoned negotiator after the session. I'm surprised - positively! What just happened? exclaimed one observer."

She said this could prejudice the review of the <span class=""highlight"">Fund</span>."
funding,"AFB Chair Khan explained that even if a decision to terminate the services of the World Bank was taken after the review in 2011, the selection of a new trustee would take some time. He indicated that, in the interests of continuity, it would be necessary to extend the World Bank's mandate until March 2014 to facilitate the operation of the <span class=""highlight"">Fund</span>. He also noted that the proposed extension would not impact the review of the <span class=""highlight"">Fund</span>."

A number of developed country parties supported using the new text while many developing countries preferred the Tianjin text. Parties agreed to give the facilitator the mandate to streamline the Tianjin text, with the understanding that it be based on discussions on what elements have to be included in the text and be brought back to the group before being forwarded to the Ministerial level for political decision."

Parties noted that this would link the issue to ongoing work under the SBSTA agenda item on <span class=""highlight"">CCS</span> under the <span class=""highlight"">CDM</span>. Many parties supported establishing a work programme to resolve these issues, but debated which body should address it.

Co-Chair Buendia noted general support for the <span class=""highlight"">CDM</span>'s continuation and asked if there were any objections to the reference. BRAZIL, supported by CHINA, highlighted that the <span class=""highlight"">CDM</span> cannot continue unless the <span class=""highlight"">Kyoto Protocol</span> continues and said a signal regarding the continuation of the <span class=""highlight"">CDM</span> requires the establishment of a <span class=""highlight"">Kyoto Protocol</span> <span class=""highlight"">second commitment period</span>. Co- Chair Buendia noted that the issue of the continuation of the <span class=""highlight"">Kyoto Protocol</span> is beyond the mandate of the contact group, which is required to consider guidance to the <span class=""highlight"">CDM</span> Executive Board regarding the governance of the <span class=""highlight"">CDM</span>."

Co-Chair Buendia, noting that no party had objected to the continuation of the <span class=""highlight"">CDM</span>, proposed deleting the paragraph and allowing the commitment to the <span class=""highlight"">CDM</span>'s continuation to be implicit. PAPUA NEW GUINEA opposed deleting the reference but said it could be bracketed for now. BOLIVIA reserved their right to return to the issue."

privileges and immunities,"On the Committee's annual report and its request to the COP/MOP concerning the legal status of Committee members, AUSTRALIA, CANADA and the EU identified the discussions under the SBI on <span class=""highlight"">privileges and immunities</span> as the best way to address this issue and proposed reflecting this in the COP/MOP decision."
compliance system|enforcement,"On general issues raised by Croatia's appeal against the <span class=""highlight"">Enforcement</span> Branch's decision, Co-Chair Tarasofsky noted that this is the first appeal to the COP/MOP by a party concerning the <span class=""highlight"">Compliance Committee</span>'s decision. He therefore identified the need for a principled discussion on how such appeals should be addressed, including parties' views on due process and remedies."
base year|compliance system|enforcement,"On the substance of Croatia's appeal, CROATIA explained that the <span class=""highlight"">Compliance Committee</span> referred the case to the COP/MOP, as the <span class=""highlight"">Enforcement</span> Branch's mandate does not cover all aspects of it. He stressed Croatia's understanding that decision 7/CP.12 (level of <span class=""highlight"">emissions</span> for the <span class=""highlight"">base year</span> of Croatia) applies fully to Croatia's Kyoto target. He noted that the <span class=""highlight"">Enforcement</span> Branch took a different view but that it is constrained by its mandate. CROATIA expressed preference for addressing the issue not through the <span class=""highlight"">Enforcement</span> Branch but through a COP/MOP decision indicating that decision 7/CP.12 applies fully to Croatia's Kyoto target."
enforcement,"The EU acknowledged Croatia's right to appeal and identified the need to be clear concerning procedural issues so that the same approach can be used in future appeals. The EU stressed, however, that the COP/MOP's decision must be limited to the basis on which Croatia's appeal has been launched. He clarified that the contact group may address Croatia's case on due process grounds, and that if the COP/MOP decides to overturn the underlying decision, it can refer the case back to the <span class=""highlight"">Enforcement</span> Branch. CROATIA underscored that such a restrictive approach is the reason Croatia finds itself in the difficult situation and that referring the case back to the <span class=""highlight"">Enforcement</span> Branch would not lead to a fair and just outcome."
base year,"Co-Chair Tarasofsky identified the possibility of adopting two COP/MOP decisions, one on the appeal and the other one on the broader issues related to Croatia's situation. The EU highlighted the contact group's very specific mandate to address Croatia's appeal, while CANADA stated that the COP/MOP can take a comprehensive approach and also address the level of <span class=""highlight"">base year</span> <span class=""highlight"">emissions</span>. AUSTRALIA indicated that while the appeal must comply with the existing rules, it is also possible to address the broader issues."

length of the commitment period,"On the <span class=""highlight"">length of commitment period</span>, parties discussed five and eight year commitment periods and described justifications for each related to: the relationship between the <span class=""highlight"">length of the commitment period</span> and need to respond to science; market certainty; coherence with the AWG-LCA; and the relationship with domestic legislation."
assigned amount units|surplus assigned amount units,"On carryover of surplus <span class=""highlight"">AAUs</span>, parties considered three options: leaving provisions unchanged; eliminating carryover; and allowing limited carryover through either a cap or domestic use of carry-over <span class=""highlight"">AAUs</span> for the second period shortfall.

Some parties called for a decision so that <span class=""highlight"">LULUCF</span> does not become a reason for a <span class=""highlight"">gap between commitment periods</span>.

Copenhagen failed to provide the necessary clarity and now time is running out, explained one carbon market expert. Negotiators also seemed to be aware of the rapidly- approaching 2012 deadline: topics discussed on Thursday included ways to send a signal on the CDM's continuation and possible crediting under JI during the increasingly likely gap period after the Kyoto Protocol's first commitment period. Familiar and highly-politicized debates also continued on issues such as CCS and nuclear energy under the CDM, creation of new market mechanisms and the merits and desirability of market approaches: Markets are not the solution, explained one observer. I have heard that the AWG-LCA plans to send the question of market mechanisms for resolution during the high-level segment, including the option that there will be no decision on the use of markets, commented one delegate on the way forward with this topic.</span>"

He said the <span class=""highlight"">AOSIS proposal</span> for a new protocol: covers all elements of the <span class=""highlight"">Bali Action Plan</span> as well as other critical elements; represents a compromise among AOSIS members; and also reflects many other parties' views."
binding commitments|kyoto protocol,"AUSTRALIA said achieving the 2Â°C target necessitates broader participation than the <span class=""highlight"">Kyoto Protocol</span>. She stressed the need for legally- <span class=""highlight"">binding commitments</span> by all major economies with differentiation between developed and developing countries. She highlighted Australia's proposal for national schedules, saying these could take into account different <span class=""highlight"">national circumstances</span>, as well as the full range of parties' mitigation efforts. AUSTRALIA stressed the AWG-LCA's central role and called for COP <span class=""highlight"">decisions from Cancun</span> outlining a way forward towards a <span class=""highlight"">legally-binding outcome</span>."
funding,"TUVALU and COSTA RICA stressed that their countries' proposals are not intended to replace the <span class=""highlight"">Kyoto Protocol</span>. TUVALU explained that his country's proposal contains provisions on: mitigation by developed and developing countries; adaptation; risk-management and risk-reduction; <span class=""highlight"">technology</span>; a <span class=""highlight"">fund</span> with different <span class=""highlight"">funding</span> windows; and immunities for persons serving under various bodies to be established. On the way forward, he stressed the contact group as the way to consider how to achieve a legally- binding outcome."

The EU reiterated willingness to commit to a <span class=""highlight"">second commitment period</span> under the <span class=""highlight"">Kyoto Protocol</span> in the context of a comprehensive global outcome."
binding commitments|kyoto protocol,"SINGAPORE and several other AOSIS members stated that the AWG-LCA's outcome must be a global and comprehensive <span class=""highlight"">legally-binding agreement</span> that is complementary to the <span class=""highlight"">Kyoto Protocol</span>. Several parties also identified the need for a channel for constructive dialogue on legal issues. SAINT LUCIA called for a decision setting out the process towards a <span class=""highlight"">legally-binding outcome</span>, indicated that the agenda item should remain open and suggested that the COP Presidency consider an inter-sessional process. The MARSHALL ISLANDS presented detailed suggestions, including extending the AWG-LCA's mandate to take into account elements from proposals under Convention Article 17."
binding commitments,"SOUTH AFRICA identified lack of clarity on the legal form of the AWG-LCA's outcome as the elephant in the room and COLOMBIA identified it as one of the problems preventing success in Copenhagen. SOUTH AFRICA supported an outcome consisting of a <span class=""highlight"">legally-binding instrument</span> from both the AWG-KP and the AWG-LCA tracks, and stressed that the bigger blueprint would be best addressed by the COP Presidency.

On the <span class=""highlight"">flexibility</span> mechanisms, he said the group had sought to identify areas where the current text could be further refined and where possibilities existed to move towards consensus text. AWG-KP Vice-Chair Macey said the group had refined options on the possible inclusion of <span class=""highlight"">carbon capture and storage</span> (<span class=""highlight"">CCS</span>) under the <span class=""highlight"">CDM</span> and that parties are also consulting on the use of <span class=""highlight"">Certified Emission Reductions</span> (<span class=""highlight"">CERs</span>) generated from projects in certain countries. Regarding the <span class=""highlight"">basket</span> of methodological issues, AWG-KP Vice- Chair Macey reported good engagement on new GHGs and common metrics to calculate GHG equivalence, highlighting areas in which the text has been streamlined.

On the commitment period, he reported convergence on a single commitment period but divergent views on whether this should be five or eight years long. On base and <span class=""highlight"">reference years</span>, he said parties had come close to a possible compromise on having a single <span class=""highlight"">base year</span> to calculate parties' Assigned Amounts and <span class=""highlight"">reference years</span> for domestic purposes. He said a text had been prepared on this issue, which enjoys broad support. On the carryover of surplus <span class=""highlight"">AAUs</span>, he said the co-facilitators have streamlined the current proposals into three options: maintaining the current provisions or removing existing provisions on carryover; limiting carryover such as through capping; or not allowing carryover."

Parties agreed to forward the draft conclusions to the SBSTA and SBI plenaries for adoption."
bali action plan,"Many identified balance as the magical ingredient for a successful outcome next Friday: We need balance between the elements of the <span class=""highlight"">Bali Action Plan</span> under the AWG-LCA, balance between the two negotiating tracks, and balance between developed and developing countries' interests, noted one expert. Countries need to be equally comfortable and equally uncomfortable with the outcome, was how Executive Secretary Figueres defined a balanced outcome."
ica|redd|mrv,"The word balance was also an answer to some delegates wondering why certain issues that many predict will be among the key Cancun outcomes have received so little attention during the first week. I can't believe that today was the first time that <span class=""highlight"">REDD</span>+ was taken up, stated one delegate. One delegate offered an explanation: Coming here, some of the AWG- LCA texts were much more advanced than others. Negotiators are trying to bring them all to a comparable level. Another cautioned: Some of us are afraid that if we open up advanced text for discussion, we may end up moving backwards. The AWG-LCA's work on <span class=""highlight"">MRV</span>/<span class=""highlight"">ICA</span> was described by many as one of the critically important but more immature elements of the AWG-LCA's work.

SAUDI ARABIA, with CHINA and others, reiterated that the form should follow function. He also stressed that the function cannot be clarified before a <span class=""highlight"">second commitment period</span> under the <span class=""highlight"">Kyoto Protocol</span> has been agreed.

shared vision|mrv,"As the second week of the UN Climate Change Conference in Cancun began, many delegates commented that they had not had much of a break on Sunday. On Sunday morning and early afternoon, they and the recently- arrived ministers had participated in the informal plenary called by COP President Patricia Espinosa in an attempt to search for further political guidance on the way forward. One delegate reported that during the plenary, COP President Espinosa announced a new working method to help move discussions forward that involved pairing ministers from developed and developing countries to work on specific issues. She announced five such pairs to work on: <span class=""highlight"">shared vision</span>; adaptation; finance, <span class=""highlight"">technology</span> and capacity building; mitigation and <span class=""highlight"">MRV</span>; and issues under the AWG-KP. Other ministers could then provide support on other specific issues as they arise. Many parties seemed happy with the COP Presidency's efforts to ensure transparency: We're starting to trust that what you see regarding the process is what you get, commented one. Another remarked on the integrity of a single process that lays to rest the ghost of Copenhagen."

I've been involved in dozens of international negotiations and in every case the work has ultimately moved to small rooms. It's still not clear to me how this process can result in the complex trade- offs that will have to be made with countries not facing a facilitator, but facing each other, said a veteran negotiator. Others began wondering about contingency plans. President Calderon of Mexico stressed his determination to get a decision on <span class=""highlight"">REDD</span>+ during his speech at <span class=""highlight"">Forest</span> Day on Sunday. Will the international community be willing to let a <span class=""highlight"">REDD</span>+ decision proceed even if the crucial issues of the future of the <span class=""highlight"">Kyoto Protocol</span> and <span class=""highlight"">MRV</span> under the AWG-LCA are not addressed? asked a conservation NGO representative, who was optimistic on these prospects."

They discussed implications of using either the <span class=""highlight"">IPCC</span> <span class=""highlight"">Second Assessment Report</span> or <span class=""highlight"">Fourth Assessment Report</span> on overall and parties' individual <span class=""highlight"">emissions</span>. Some parties highlighted the importance of using methodologies that are consistent with the AWG-LCA.

Parties then discussed harvested <span class=""highlight"">wood</span> products, underscoring that bioenergy will be accounted for by the <span class=""highlight"">energy</span> sector. Parties also addressed _force majeure_ and the challenges posed by accounting for fires. On <span class=""highlight"">reference levels</span>, discussions considered the need to reflect both complexity and <span class=""highlight"">flexibility</span> in addressing different <span class=""highlight"">national circumstances</span>."

The text includes new language on, _inter alia_: historical and current global <span class=""highlight"">emissions</span>; stabilizing GHG concentrations at well below 350 parts per million; collectively <span class=""highlight"">reducing emissions by at least 50% from 1990 levels by 2050; reducing GHG emissions of developed countries by 85-95%, or more than 95%, from 1990 levels by 2050; and respecting human rights.</span>"
technology|technology transfer,"Parties also discussed text proposed by a number of developing countries on <span class=""highlight"">historical responsibility</span> and implementation gaps. Several countries supported affirming that climate change is one of the greatest challenges facing mankind and that parties share a vision that enhances the Convention's implementation, sets an <span class=""highlight"">emissions</span> goal rather than a hard cap, and guides the actions and policies of parties taking into consideration their different and evolving circumstances. A number of developing countries emphasized <span class=""highlight"">historical responsibility</span> and urged Annex I countries to show leadership, including on finance and <span class=""highlight"">technology</span> transfer. Many developed countries stressed that the Convention refers to historic and current <span class=""highlight"">emissions</span>."
forest,"A request was also made to insert text on requiring Annex I parties to contribute 6% of their Gross National Product (GNP) to finance <span class=""highlight"">mitigation and adaptation</span> in developing countries and 1% of their GNP to support <span class=""highlight"">forest</span>-related activities as repayment of their climate debt. Several developed countries suggested using the facilitator's text as a middle ground, while some developing countries said there was no agreement on whether to proceed, because of the absence of a party-driven text. The facilitators will consult the AWG-LCA Chair."
funding|financial mechanism,"FINANCE, <span class=""highlight"">TECHNOLOGY</span> AND CAPACITY BUILDING (AWG-LCA): Finance:   In a morning drafting group, parties were presented with a revised non-paper containing elements for a draft decision on finance. The document included sections and options on <span class=""highlight"">fast-start finance</span>, <span class=""highlight"">long-term finance</span>, the proposed new <span class=""highlight"">fund</span> and a proposed new body under the COP to assist with the <span class=""highlight"">financial mechanism</span> and delivery of climate financing. The non-paper also included an annex containing terms of reference for designing the <span class=""highlight"">fund</span>."

One developing country suggested adding another developing country group to those identified as priority recipients of <span class=""highlight"">fast-start financing</span>. In addition to <span class=""highlight"">LDCs</span>, <span class=""highlight"">SIDS</span> and Africa, she added developing countries with areas prone to <span class=""highlight"">droughts</span>, floods and <span class=""highlight"">desertification</span> with fragile <span class=""highlight"">ecosystems</span>, and facing increased frequency of extreme and catastrophic events and trends linked to climate change."
funding,"On <span class=""highlight"">long-term finance</span>, developing countries supported the option that developed countries should commit 1.5% of their GDP to support developing countries, rather than text referring to a US$100 billion commitment annually by 2020. Many developed countries expressed reservations on text indicating that the main or major source of <span class=""highlight"">funding</span> will be assessed or indicative contributions from Annex II parties to the Convention. Some developed countries supported reference to the UN Secretary-General's High- Level Advisory Group on Climate Financing."
technology,"<span class=""highlight"">Technology</span>:   The drafting group considered <span class=""highlight"">technology</span> in a late morning session. Developing countries outlined two possible decisions, one containing the main elements of an agreement, the other setting out a programme of work. Several delegates welcomed progress in this group and in bilateral consultations held earlier in the day. However, some developed countries regretted that the balance they seek in the wider negotiations does not yet exist, and said they could not yet agree to a <span class=""highlight"">technology</span> mechanism. Several speakers supported identifying what can be agreed in Cancun and what needs further discussion in 2011."
funding|financial mechanism,"Capacity building:   In the afternoon, the informal drafting group turned its attention to capacity-building. Parties considered a revised draft text paragraph-by-paragraph. Many developing country parties supported retaining the option to establish a technical panel on capacity building in a <span class=""highlight"">legally-binding instrument</span>, while many developed countries supported an option affirming that existing institutional arrangements or the proposed ones include capacity-building in their mandate. On references to operating entities of the <span class=""highlight"">financial mechanism</span> and reference to the proposed new <span class=""highlight"">fund</span>, one party said these could prejudge other parallel negotiations. Different views also remained on text concerning developed country reporting of support provided for capacity building in developing countries, and developing country reporting of progress in enhancing capacity to address climate change, including on the use of the support received. Consultations continued."
mitigation actions,"MITIGATION (various approaches, including opportunities for using markets, to enhance the cost-effectiveness of, and to promote, <span class=""highlight"">mitigation actions</span>)     (AWG-LCA):   The morning drafting group continued consideration of revised text, prepared on the basis of the AWG-LCA Chair's note. Parties continued streamlining the options."
mitigation actions|namas,"Many parties expressed satisfaction with the fact that the texts contain decision language, while highlighting various omissions. Many parties perceived a lack of balance between the texts and also between the texts and other work by the AWG-LCA. Several parties lamented the lack of operational language with regard to, _inter alia_, <span class=""highlight"">mitigation actions</span>, reporting commitments and the <span class=""highlight"">development</span> of guidelines for accounting and other rules. Parties continued to express diverging views on the purpose and scope of the proposed registry, with some stating that it should contain all <span class=""highlight"">NAMAs</span> by developing countries, while others said all <span class=""highlight"">NAMAs</span> should be inscribed in an annex to a decision and the proposed registry should be restricted to <span class=""highlight"">NAMAs</span> seeking support. Parties also differed on the frequency and nature of reporting, as well as the body that should decide these matters (whether it should be the AWG-LCA or the SBI)."
mitigation actions,"A number of parties also commented on whether developed countries should take on <span class=""highlight"">mitigation actions</span> or commitments, the level and legal nature or framework of such actions or commitments, and their relationship with the <span class=""highlight"">Kyoto Protocol</span>. Some parties highlighted the need to address the issue of comparability of actions or commitments, both among developed countries and between developed and developing countries. A number of parties also suggested that all countries' pledges be anchored in an annex to a <span class=""highlight"">decision in Cancun</span>. However, others opposed this suggestion. Informal informal consultations will continue."
agriculture,"MITIGATION (<span class=""highlight"">sectoral approaches</span> and sector-specific actions) (AWG-LCA):  During informal consultations in the morning, parties reported on discussions held on the general framework and on <span class=""highlight"">agriculture</span>."
food|agriculture|food security,"On <span class=""highlight"">agriculture</span>, discussions addressed both expectations regarding a work programme and the identification of key elements for the sector, including trade, adaptation, <span class=""highlight"">food</span> security and indigenous peoples' involvement. Many parties expressed <span class=""highlight"">flexibility</span> to work based on different existing texts provided that key elements are included."
bunker fuels|agriculture,"On the way forward, disagreement persisted, with many parties preferring to address the general framework and then specific sectors, while others supported discussing <span class=""highlight"">bunker fuels</span> and <span class=""highlight"">agriculture</span>. Finally, agreement was reached on addressing an overarching general framework paragraph and then discussing possible provisions for framing each sector, with many noting that the <span class=""highlight"">agriculture</span> text is complete enough as it is."
bunker fuels|maritime|technology transfer|technology,"Parties also discussed the key elements to be considered within the general framework, such as: reference to Convention Article 4.1(c) (<span class=""highlight"">technology</span> transfer); the usefulness of taking a <span class=""highlight"">sectoral approach</span>; a reference to the principles of the Convention; and the voluntary nature of <span class=""highlight"">sectoral approaches</span>. Divergent views remained on the two last elements, with many countries supporting the need for consistency with the provisions and principles of the Convention and the inclusion of a reference to the principle of common but <span class=""highlight"">differentiated responsibilities</span>. Some parties disagreed with the consideration of this principle in the context of <span class=""highlight"">bunker fuels</span>, but one party noted that the International Civil Aviation Organization has already recognized differences among countries. Different opinions were expressed on whether the principle of common but <span class=""highlight"">differentiated responsibilities</span> should apply to technical and operational matters under the International <span class=""highlight"">Maritime</span> Organization."
bunker fuels|agriculture,"In the afternoon drafting group, divergent views were expressed on using the Copenhagen or Tianjin text, or combination of the two texts. Parties also discussed whether to give the facilitator the mandate to make changes to be reflected in the upcoming AWG-LCA Chair's text. Discussions then focused on the consideration of trade in the <span class=""highlight"">agriculture</span> text with parties making proposals for compromise text. Discussions continued into the evening on a framing paragraph, <span class=""highlight"">bunker fuels</span> and what can be reflected in a revised text."
future commitments|second commitment period|kyoto protocol,"ITEM 3 (Annex I <span class=""highlight"">further commitments</span>) (AWG-KP):   In an evening contact group, AWG-KP Chair John Ashe (Antigua and Barbuda) highlighted a revised version of the Chair's text (FCCC/KP/CRP.4/Rev.1) and subsequent meetings by the spin-off groups. AWG-KP Chair Ashe described the appointment of ministers from the UK and Brazil to conduct ministerial consultations on key political questions. BRAZIL then provided an overview of these consultations with negotiating groups and countries. He identified challenges in relation to establishing a <span class=""highlight"">second commitment period</span> under the <span class=""highlight"">Kyoto Protocol</span> and interlinkages with the AWG-LCA's mitigation discussions. Luis Alfonso de Alba (Mexico) reported that COP/MOP President Espinosa would meet with ministers to consider the way forward and that a COP/MOP stocktaking plenary would convene early on Wednesday morning."
cdm projects|cdm|flexibility|flexibility mechanisms,"On the <span class=""highlight"">flexibility</span> mechanisms, AWG-KP Vice-Chair Adrian Macey (New Zealand) noted a proposal to continue the Kyoto mechanisms beyond the first commitment period, as well as discussions on regional distribution of <span class=""highlight"">CDM</span> project activities and co-benefits."
assigned amount units|surplus assigned amount units,"Co-facilitator Leon Charles (Grenada) reported that the numbers group had continued consideration of carryover and surplus of <span class=""highlight"">AAUs</span>, and that it had also considered how to streamline the textual proposals. He explained that, despite a lack of consensus, there was a desire to address surplus and carryover of <span class=""highlight"">AAUs</span>. He added that the group could benefit from more time to address this issue."
emissions scenarios,"Given slow progress on many issues expected to be among the key Cancun outcomes, concerns were beginning to surface about whether and how all the necessary elements of the overall package will fall into place. One negotiator worried that the process might get bogged down in an attitude of no progress on anything until we have progress on everything. Many seasoned negotiators acknowledged that it will be difficult to close the gaps, although there were some indications that negotiators were starting to identify where trade-offs could work between the different negotiating blocks, and some also began to contemplate Plan B <span class=""highlight"">scenarios</span>."
redd,"For example, some <span class=""highlight"">REDD</span>+ negotiators were seen working on strategies to ensure that if a comprehensive decision cannot be reached, a simpler agreement to move forward on <span class=""highlight"">REDD</span>+ could be ensured as a basis for the ongoing initiatives in many developing countries. One veteran delegate noted: Eager parties are redoubling efforts in an attempt to ensure agreement on <span class=""highlight"">REDD</span>+ is not held hostage to other issues and they are simultaneously attempting to accommodate different philosophical views on markets and safeguards."
redd|mrv,"In the morning informal stocktaking plenary, COP President Espinosa highlighted the atmosphere of inclusiveness and the open and transparent process in Cancun. She welcomed ministerial consultations to address political issues. AWG-LCA Chair Mukahanana-Sangarwe said her revised Chair's note (FCCC/AWGLCA/2010/CRP.3) reflects advances on <span class=""highlight"">REDD</span>+ and adaptation, a clear set of options on <span class=""highlight"">MRV</span> and finance, and a lack of movement on <span class=""highlight"">technology</span>. She suggested that political guidance is needed on mitigation by developed and developing countries, <span class=""highlight"">MRV</span> of commitments and actions, long- term finance, a long-term global goal and <span class=""highlight"">equity</span>. Chair Mukahanana-Sangarwe noted that the new paper calls for extending the work of the AWG-LCA. COP President Espinosa underscored that there would be no overlapping or parallel processes and stressed the need for the outcome of the AWG-LCA to be ready by Friday morning."
bali action plan,"PARTIES' PROPOSALS UNDER CONVENTION ARTICLE 17 (protocols) (COP):   During informal consultations, a group of developing countries introduced a draft COP decision for consideration by parties. The text recognized the complementary, interrelated and mutually supportive nature of the AWG-KP and AWG-LCA, and the need for comprehensive and legally-<span class=""highlight"">binding instruments</span> for all parties from the work of both _Ad-Hoc _Working Groups. The text also asked the AWG-LCA to continue its work and present a legally- binding instrument for adoption at COP 17. Additionally, the text indicated that the instrument will be based on the <span class=""highlight"">Bali Action Plan</span>, the work of the AWG-LCA to date, COP 16 outcomes and decisions, and parties' proposals under UNFCCC Article 17 (protocols)."
cdm,"<span class=""highlight"">CDM</span> (COP/MOP):   During informal consultations, parties continued discussing the draft COP/MOP decision on further guidance relating to the <span class=""highlight"">CDM</span>. Regarding the eligibility of <span class=""highlight"">new technologies</span> and scopes under the <span class=""highlight"">CDM</span>, parties continued to hold diverging opinions. Several pointed out that this issue is being addressed by the SBSTA and cautioned against prejudging conclusions."
transport|international aviation|bunker fuels|maritime|maritime transport|agriculture,"MITIGATION (<span class=""highlight"">sectoral approaches</span>) (AWG-LCA):   In the morning, parties considered new draft text by the facilitator. They initially considered the facilitator's note as a basis for moving forward with discussions. After some substantive discussion on <span class=""highlight"">bunker fuels</span>, <span class=""highlight"">agriculture</span> and general framing, parties could not agree to continue with the facilitator's note. Some developing countries noted that the text under the general framework and on <span class=""highlight"">international aviation</span> and <span class=""highlight"">maritime</span> <span class=""highlight"">transport</span> did not reflect what parties agreed in Tianjin, and some preferred that the general framework only have one option. Many suggested bringing general framework text from Tianjin into the facilitator's note. A number of parties expressed disappointment with the proliferation of options that represent either/or decisions, while others suggested that the options could represent a starting point for ministers to find middle ground. In the incorporation of additional language from Tianjin, some parties requested that their options be retained in the facilitator's note."
bunker fuels|agriculture,"Many parties expressed support for the <span class=""highlight"">agriculture</span> text. Some suggested that <span class=""highlight"">agriculture</span> be discussed separately from <span class=""highlight"">bunker fuels</span> and the general framework. However, others disagreed with this proposal. Parties agreed to hold informal informal consultations on <span class=""highlight"">agriculture</span> in the evening."
funding|adaptation fund,"ADAPTATION <span class=""highlight"">FUND</span> (COP/MOP):   During the morning informal consultations, parties were invited to comment on revised draft text relating to proposed regional workshops aimed at familiarizing parties with the process and requirements for accrediting national implementing agencies. Developing countries expressed a preference for organizing up to four workshops, while some developed countries favored three, emphasizing their <span class=""highlight"">flexibility</span> on this since they would have preferred a decision on the workshops to be postponed until next year to allow more experience to be gained with direct access. Discussions were then suspended to allow parties to consult on these issues. They were not able to reach agreement and the informal consultations were suspended until Thursday."
future commitments|second commitment period,"CHAPTER I (numbers) (AWG-KP):   In the afternoon, the informal AWG-KP drafting group on numbers continued discussions on how to clean up text in Option B (consequential Protocol amendments). Parties focused on consequential amendments to Protocol Article 3.9 (Annex I parties' <span class=""highlight"">further commitments</span>) related to establishment of commitments for a third or subsequent commitment periods, including how long before the end of the <span class=""highlight"">second commitment period</span> such negotiations should begin. The Chair's text remained largely unchanged."
lulucf|forest|forest management,"CHAPTER II (<span class=""highlight"">LULUCF</span>) (AWG-KP):   In the afternoon informal consultations, parties agreed to address the five options on accounting for <span class=""highlight"">forest</span> management in order to streamline text, and ensure consistency and clear options. Parties discussed option 1 on <span class=""highlight"">reference levels</span>, with many proposing amendments, including on a footnote addressing the setting of <span class=""highlight"">forest</span> management <span class=""highlight"">reference levels</span>. Divergent views remained."
baselines,"Parties then addressed option 2 on <span class=""highlight"">baselines</span> and agreed to apply the amendments already agreed to in option 1 in selected paragraphs. Option 3 on net-net accounting was discussed, with parties making some proposals that were not retained. A party proposed, and many opposed, deleting option 4 on a cap. One party announced that he would present new proposals on _force majeure _and harvested <span class=""highlight"">wood</span> products."
second commitment period|kyoto protocol,"On introducing a fee for project activities under <span class=""highlight"">JI</span> Track 1, parties discussed: the level of such a fee; the possibility of differentiated fee levels for large- and small-scale projects; and the point at which the fee would be payable. One party said it was too early to agree on the level of the fee and that instead, a process should be established for determining the fee at a later time. Some parties proposed, opposed by a number of others, insertion of text referring to the fee becoming applicable after the adoption of a <span class=""highlight"">second Kyoto Protocol commitment period</span>."
emissions scenarios|second commitment period|kyoto protocol,"On the paragraphs taking note of the <span class=""highlight"">JI</span> Supervisory Committee's (JISC) view on the need for a new <span class=""highlight"">JI</span> operational model beyond 2012 and the <span class=""highlight"">scenarios</span> for improving <span class=""highlight"">JI</span> beyond 2012, some parties objected to these paragraphs, highlighting the need for clarity regarding references to beyond 2012 and the relationship with the <span class=""highlight"">Kyoto Protocol</span>. Various proposals were made, including: deletion of the references to beyond 2012; deletion of the entire paragraph, since the JISC's report is already acknowledged elsewhere in the text; and replacing beyond 2012 with in the <span class=""highlight"">second commitment period</span> of the <span class=""highlight"">Kyoto Protocol</span>. Parties could not reach agreement on these paragraphs and consultations will continue."
technology|technology transfer,"Early on Wednesday morning, delegates arrived at the Moon Palace to take part in the COP and COP/MOP informal stocktaking plenaries, scheduled for 8:30 am and 9:05 am respectively. As anticipated, President Espinosa announced that the new AWG-KP and AWG-LCA texts were now available for delegates to start reviewing. Delegates' reactions to these texts varied: The texts contain many of the elements that parties have been pushing for and should satisfy most interests observed one optimistic delegate. A veteran negotiator also commented that the texts look much better and there has been progress on <span class=""highlight"">technology</span> transfer, capacity building and adaptation. Another explained that further work is still essential: We are not quite there yet, but I feel we are moving in the right direction."
technology transfer|technology|funding|climate change impacts|forest|emission|co2,"Apart from the continuously intensifying negotiations, a large number of other events took place in and around the Moon Palace throughout the day. In the early evening, for instance, many journalists and observers attended a dialogue convened by Mexican President Felipe Calderon. In the first session on Consequences of <span class=""highlight"">inaction</span>: our responsibility to act now, Heads of State from Ethiopia, Palau, Grenada and Honduras, as well as the Chairperson of the Commission of the African Union, presented testimony about the <span class=""highlight"">effects of climate change</span> and described the adaptation strategies they are pursuing. They urged leaders to agree on more ambitious commitments to climate change mitigation and requested further support for <span class=""highlight"">technology</span> transfer and <span class=""highlight"">funding</span> for developing countries' ongoing adaptation efforts. Claps and exclamations were heard when President Calderon announced that payments to <span class=""highlight"">indigenous peoples </span>protecting <span class=""highlight"">forests</span> in Oaxaca will be made to neutralize COP 16 <span class=""highlight"">CO2</span> <span class=""highlight"">emissions</span>. He invited Annex I parties to participate by also neutralizing their own travel <span class=""highlight"">emissions</span>."

Informal meetings met well into the evening to resolve key sticking points. After one informal meeting on mitigation ended in the early evening, some described the mood as cautiously optimistic that Cancun will result in something we can all be somewhat happy with. However, according to one delegate, anchoring the pledges and <span class=""highlight"">MRV</span>, together with financing, remain problematic. The question hanging over the Moon Palace was therefore What is on the list for a <span class=""highlight"">Cancun decision</span> package? Delegates began to suggest that <span class=""highlight"">REDD</span>+, a process towards the new <span class=""highlight"">fund</span>, adaptation and <span class=""highlight"">fast-start financing</span> were all nearly ready to go, but President Espinosa reminded delegates that while an agreement was within grasp, it was still elusive."
reducing emissions|emission|second commitment period|assigned amount units|gap between commitment periods,"Parties discussed a paragraph allowing crediting from <span class=""highlight"">JI</span> projects after the first commitment period, using <span class=""highlight"">Assigned Amount Units</span> (<span class=""highlight"">AAUs</span>) from the first commitment period. Several parties objected to this paragraph, stating that a conversion of first commitment period <span class=""highlight"">AAUs</span> to <span class=""highlight"">Emission</span> Reduction Units (ERUs) must be based on <span class=""highlight"">emission</span> reductions achieved in the first commitment period. One party noted that his country is not in a position to accept any text that deals with <span class=""highlight"">emission</span> reductions achieved after 2012. A number of parties proposed alternative formulations to address the issue, such as requesting the AWG-KP to: propose options for addressing a potential <span class=""highlight"">gap between the first and</span> <span class=""highlight"">second commitment periods</span> and present the work to COP/MOP 7; or consider the <span class=""highlight"">JI</span> Supervisory Committee's proposal with regard to the generation of ERUs after 31 December 2012."
bali action plan,"MITIGATION (response measures) (AWG-LCA):   In the morning AWG-LCA drafting group on the sub-paragraph 1(b)(vi) of the <span class=""highlight"">Bali Action Plan</span>, parties disagreed on which text they should use as the basis for further discussions. Many developing countries supported using text from Tianjin as modified by negotiations in the drafting group, while some developed countries supported using the new Chair's text as the basis for compromise. One developed country proposed using the new Chair's text to move forward while inserting some missing options to reflect all parties' views and provide a basis for political decisions by ministers. This proposal was supported by several other developed countries, but opposed by many developing countries. Parties agreed to continue meeting to consolidate similar options within their groups in the hope of presenting the Chair with two clear options on each controversial issue."
funding|adaptation fund,"ADAPTATION <span class=""highlight"">FUND</span> (COP/MOP):   Parties reconvened for informal consultations in the morning, engaging in extensive debate over text dealing with regional and sub-regional workshops aimed at familiarizing parties with the process and requirements for the accreditation of national implementing entities. While developing countries wanted at least three workshops with the possibility of another, some developed countries wanted up to threeâ€¦ as circumstances permit. Parties eventually agreed a formulation that would allow for up to threeâ€¦ as appropriate, with the possibility of another as circumstances permit, and as warrantedâ€¦"
compliance system|enforcement,"COMPLIANCE (COP/MOP):   During the afternoon contact group, parties considered a draft COP/MOP decision on the <span class=""highlight"">Compliance Committee</span>'s report, as well as bracketed draft text on Croatia's appeal against a decision of the <span class=""highlight"">Enforcement</span> Branch. Parties agreed to forward the draft decision to the COP/MOP."
base year|future commitments|assigned amount units,"CHAPTER I (numbers) (AWG-KP):   Parties discussed options for removing brackets on proposed text to amend Protocol Article 3.9 (Annex I <span class=""highlight"">further commitments</span>) concerning when to start consideration of commitments for the third and subsequent commitment periods. Parties also discussed <span class=""highlight"">base year</span>. On a carryover of <span class=""highlight"">AAUs</span>, some parties expressed interest in combining options, while others preferred no change to the existing rules. One country proposed text on an option for a 5% cap that applies only to the first commitment period. Another party suggested limits on a fixed amount of <span class=""highlight"">emissions</span> or a percentage, whichever is greater. The group forwarded the text to the Chair of the AWG-KP."
cdm,"<span class=""highlight"">CDM</span> (COP/MOP):   The <span class=""highlight"">CDM</span> contact group convened on Thursday evening. PAPUA NEW GUINEA, supported by SOUTH AFRICA, opposed the introduction of new text by the Co-Chairs, stating that the text had already been gaveled during informal consultations last night. He stressed the party- driven nature of the negotiations, observing that the text appears from nowhere."
cdm projects|cdm,"Going through the text, parties agreed on all paragraphs apart from paragraph 52 on the Executive Board revising the procedures for <span class=""highlight"">CDM</span> project registration to allow the crediting period to start from the date that a complete request for registration has been submitted, which was bracketed at the request of Bolivia. PAPUA NEW GUINEA stressed that the paragraph relates to his country's proposal and suggested leaving it bracketed without further informal consultations, saying they were unlikely to yield results."
cdm,"Parties also discussed three annexes to the draft COP/MOP decision. BOLIVIA requested bracketing all of them, saying parties had not had time to analyze them and also noting concerns about issues related to code of conduct and conflict of interest. JAPAN stressed the enormous effort to provide text in the annexes to everyone a month before the meeting, and that the annexes were adopted two days ago. BOLIVIA underscored the importance of environmental integrity, and indicated that the bracketed paragraph is only meant to make more money with the <span class=""highlight"">CDM</span> and for the investors without helping the climate. Co-Chair Shimada indicated that all annexes remain in brackets. Informal consultations continued."
bunker fuels|agriculture,"MITIGATION (<span class=""highlight"">sectoral approaches</span> and sector-specific actions) (AWG-LCA):   During informal consultations, it was suggested that possible outcomes from Cancun could include a simplified text on the general framework with a streamlined and clear text on <span class=""highlight"">agriculture</span>, and that these texts could be forwarded for further discussion to the next session of the group, in 2011. Many parties opposed working on the general framework in the absence of agreement on the text on <span class=""highlight"">bunker fuels</span>. Some supported addressing the text on <span class=""highlight"">agriculture</span> and the general framework in small parallel groups. Many others supported considering the general framework and then the <span class=""highlight"">agriculture</span> text in a small group. Parties eventually agreed to convene a friends-of-the-facilitator group and report back to the main group."
lulucf|harvested wood products,"CHAPTER II (<span class=""highlight"">LULUCF</span>) (AWG-KP):   In the morning informal consultations, new proposals were made on text on harvested <span class=""highlight"">wood</span> products, _force majeure _and on a cap for <span class=""highlight"">LULUCF</span>. Parties continued to discuss the review process for <span class=""highlight"">reference levels</span>. Late into the evening, parties considered how to reflect their work in a new Chair's text on Friday."

He said that the inclusion of <span class=""highlight"">CCS</span> under the <span class=""highlight"">CDM</span> and standardized <span class=""highlight"">baselines</span> have been put on hold because they are under consideration by the COP/MOP based on work by the SBSTA. He described three sets of decisions: political decisions; those linked to ongoing AWG-KP discussions; and those related to work in the AWG-LCA.

At that stage, others said there was little positive to note coming out of discussions on adaptation, finance and a <span class=""highlight"">shared vision</span>.

The stocktaking ended at around 11 pm with a reminder from President Espinosa that very few hours for actual negotiating remained. Already-tired delegates therefore prepared themselves for another marathon all-nighter. One high-level representative indicated that there is still a deal to be done - but we could also end up with a belly flop."

He said that while it was expected the group could finish consideration of the majority of issues, those issues that remained unsolved could be forwarded to the presidency for resolution, notably those requiring political decisions. Saint Lucia, for AOSIS, said legal issues should be also addressed in Durban. Tuvalu, for <span class=""highlight"">LDCs</span>, called for an amendment to the <span class=""highlight"">Kyoto Protocol</span> that would be <span class=""highlight"">ratifiable</span> and provisionally enter into force to avoid a gap."

The EU observed that the draft governing instrument is a compromise but agreement should be reached on it as part of a balanced package, and further discussions would be counterproductive. Zambia, for <span class=""highlight"">LDCs</span>, said the draft governing instrument provides sufficient basis for a financial institutional arrangement. The Philippines, for the G-77/CHINA, said the <span class=""highlight"">GCF</span> is a crucial element of the solution."

accounting rules,"DEVELOPING COUNTRY MITIGATION (AWG-LCA):   During informal consultations, many parties expressed support for the non-papers as a basis for further discussions. BOLIVIA expressed concern that requirements being imposed on developed and developing countries are too similar. The EU reiterated that progress on these issues is a key part of the <span class=""highlight"">Durban package</span> and suggested that text for a decision focus on the same areas identified for developed countries' mitigation issues. Switzerland, for the EIG, highlighted three key issues: ambition and the need for information on the <span class=""highlight"">ambition gap</span>; clarification of ambition; and common <span class=""highlight"">accounting rules</span>."

AFB Chair Ana Fornells de Frutos (Spain) presented on the terms of reference for the report and an overview of how the performance review was conducted. She noted that regional workshops held recently in Senegal and Panama had been viewed as very productive. The UNFCCC Secretariat noted that two remaining workshops are expected for 2012, one in Asia and the other in the Pacific. Parties then reflected on a recent consultant's report on the Performance Review of the secretariat and Trustee, noting concern over the low price of <span class=""highlight"">CERs</span> and implications on AFB operations.

The US, EU and <span class=""highlight"">LDCs</span> also suggested that the text on thematic areas could be further elaborated. On the form of the outcome, the Cook Islands, for AOSIS, preferred a COP decision rather than SBI conclusions. The EU suggested focusing first on content, then on the nature of the outcome. Facilitator Owen-Jones invited written inputs and indicated that the text would be revised in light of these."

NORWAY opposed this, stating that national <span class=""highlight"">adaptation plans</span> should only apply to the <span class=""highlight"">LDCs</span>, as mandated. The US suggested sections on: general framing for national <span class=""highlight"">adaptation plans</span>; a process on enabling the <span class=""highlight"">LDCs</span> to formulate and implement those plans; and inviting other developing countries to employ the modalities for the plans. On finance, Bolivia, for the G-77/CHINA, requested reference to interim and <span class=""highlight"">long-term financing</span>. Bangladesh, for the <span class=""highlight"">LDCs</span>, said text on providing finance, <span class=""highlight"">technology</span> and capacity building should be specific to <span class=""highlight"">LDCs</span>.

One experienced NGO noted that with many issues still left on the table, some negotiators don't seem to be aware time is running out."

Many parties supported presenting the four options to the ministers and indicated their preferences. While many developing parties supported the third option to set up a process, some developed countries supported the two first options to discuss the numbers. A group of developing countries cautioned against the third option, urging for the establishment of numbers to ensure peaking by 2015. One developing country supported forwarding the non-paper coming from Panama as is without presenting any options, while other parties said forwarding options or the non-paper is premature. Many developing countries said dropping the issue is not an option, while some others highlighted that it is the default option in case no agreement is reached.

A group of developed countries said that language on <span class=""highlight"">fast-start finance</span> was more suited to the preamble. Some developed countries said that it was discouraging to receive so little credit for efforts towards <span class=""highlight"">fast-start finance</span> and called for a paragraph on enhancing transparency to be deleted.

Regarding carryover of <span class=""highlight"">AAUs</span>, one developed country party indicated she could accept the proposal of a developing country party, except for wording on how to distribute benefits and share of proceeds. The proponent responded that they were flexible on the percentage of proceeds and on the use of units for domestic compliance. Another proposal by a <span class=""highlight"">small island</span> state was also discussed, with one developed country saying taxation for carryover <span class=""highlight"">AAUs</span> was still too high, and noting her country counted on keeping saved <span class=""highlight"">AAUs</span> for a <span class=""highlight"">second commitment period</span>.

Many parties noted agreement on the continuation of the Convention principles, with: CHINA stressing CBDR; BARBADOS and NORWAY highlighting the <span class=""highlight"">precautionary principle</span>; and the US suggesting that principles need to evolve to reflect changing circumstances and capabilities. The US further stressed that: financial contributions will depend on what is deliverable; and a successful and ambitious agreement applicable to all requires <span class=""highlight"">flexibility</span>, fairness and transparency to allow accountability for collective adequacy. SWITZERLAND invited parties to apply the Convention principles in a manner that empowers us to do more and not as an excuse to do nothing. The RUSSIAN FEDERATION stressed that decision 1/CP.17 clearly recognizes that climate change has to be urgently addressed by all parties. BOLIVIA emphasized that mitigation has to be undertaken in conjunction with <span class=""highlight"">poverty</span> eradication and sustainable <span class=""highlight"">development</span>. CHINA stressed that recategorizing developing countries would amount to reinterpretation of the Convention. JAPAN said universal peer review could provide a tool to incentivize participation."

Discussions focused on adequacy and sustainability of <span class=""highlight"">funds</span> for the Adaptation <span class=""highlight"">Fund</span>, and a possible extension of the interim trustee's term. On adequacy and sustainability of <span class=""highlight"">funds</span>, some developed countries suggested taking up the discussion under the agenda item on the report of the Adaptation <span class=""highlight"">Fund</span> under the CMP or under the report of the Standing Committee under the COP. Many developing countries said that tight timelines should not preclude the consideration of this matter by the group and supported retaining the paragraphs in the text."

Switzerland, for the EIG, warned against attempts to revisit everything, raise artificially high expectations and focus on things that divide us. JAPAN lamented lack of recognition by developing countries of progress on finance, including fast- track finance and the establishment of the Standing Committee. Several developed countries emphasized that discussions on issues, including adaptation and finance, will continue under other processes after the termination of the AWG-LCA. The EU drew attention, _inter alia_, to: the Adaptation Committee and the Standing Committee; and work on <span class=""highlight"">long-term finance</span> and national <span class=""highlight"">adaptation plans</span>. BARBADOS emphasized that there is no process outside the AWG-LCA to consider the <span class=""highlight"">post-2012</span> financing gap and that the Green Climate <span class=""highlight"">Fund</span> remains an empty shell."
additionality|bali action plan|market mechanisms|market approaches,"The EU highlighted specific tasks in the AWG-LCA's mandate, saying that no decision on <span class=""highlight"">market approaches</span> would mean no process to consider the issue after Doha. BRAZIL suggested that <span class=""highlight"">market mechanisms</span> be discussed under the ADP, while the EU raised concerns over this idea. VENEZUELA stressed that the text on paragraph 1(b)(v) of the <span class=""highlight"">Bali Action Plan</span> (market and non- <span class=""highlight"">market approaches</span>) had been rejected by many developing countries during informal consultations, and objected to presenting the text as the basis for further negotiations.

bali action plan,"COLOMBIA urged: identifying under which bodies the <span class=""highlight"">Bali Action Plan</span> can continue to be implemented; giving closure to what can be closed; and giving comfort to those who feel some issues are not reflected in the text. BRAZIL highlighted the need to wrap up everything under the AWG- LCA's mandate and stressed that solving all these issues is a precondition for meaningful work under the ADP. SOUTH AFRICA and others emphasized that the closing text of the AWG-LCA must encompass all issues under the AWG-LCA's mandate, and that some issues require more elaboration. MEXICO identified the need to take into consideration outcomes from COP 16 and 17, and consider what else needs to be done.

second commitment period,"AWG-KP Vice-Chair Jukka Uosukainen (Finland) reported good progress in his informal consultations on matters relating to the <span class=""highlight"">second commitment period</span>. He noted that some paragraphs in the draft CMP decision on Protocol amendments remain in brackets for practical and tactical reasons, waiting for progress in other groups rather than representing real, unsolved issues. He explained that issues related to the provisional application of the <span class=""highlight"">second commitment period</span> (paragraphs 7-11) in the revised text remain to be solved. Vice-Chair Uosukainen identified three options for provisional application: opting out; opting in; and an implementing decision, saying these options are not necessarily mutually exclusive."

She explained that parties' views on the length of the <span class=""highlight"">second commitment period</span>, <span class=""highlight"">QELROs</span> and ambition are still divergent. On the Protocol's legal continuity from 1 January 2013, she said options are fewer and clearer, and asked whether parties see possibility of convergence. On the Protocol's operational continuity for Annex I parties from 1 January 2013, she reported that proposals are on the table but identified the need for more time to discuss them."

second commitment period|assigned amount units|surplus assigned amount units,"The EU underscored that parties have been working on the issues of carry-over of <span class=""highlight"">AAUs</span> and increasing ambition, calling for the fruits of this work to be tabled before forwarding the text to ministers. Saint Lucia, for AOSIS, and several developing countries, stressed the need to achieve a higher level of ambition. She lamented that some parties have dropped to the lower end of their pledges despite their clear mandate to move up to the top end of their pledges, and noted their conditionalities have been met with the creation of the ADP process. The PHILIPPINES urged parties to walk fast, far and forward. AUSTRALIA identified ambition as a broader issue that must be addressed beyond the Protocol's <span class=""highlight"">second commitment period</span>. SWITZERLAND identified addressing the carry-over of surplus <span class=""highlight"">AAUs</span> as a way to raise ambition."

Many parties supported requesting submissions from parties on various themes. However, while not ruling out thematic discussions, some parties expressed discomfort with a sector approach to raising ambition."

CAN emphasized, during its afternoon press conference, that closing the AWG-LCA is not just a matter of switching off the lights and leaving as all the negotiating tracks are linked and fundamental issues under the <span class=""highlight"">Bali Action Plan</span> must be resolved. CAN identified finance as one such fundamental issue, calling for a credible trajectory towards 2020 with innovative sources of financing from a levy on international air and <span class=""highlight"">maritime</span> <span class=""highlight"">transport</span>, as well as a financial transaction tax."

Swaziland, for the AFRICAN GROUP, called for a decision on finance, scaling up mitigation and support for adaptation. SWITZERLAND said financing is a core and ongoing issue that cannot be concluded in Doha, and that a COP decision is needed to define how to continue working on it. The EU expressed disappointment over the <span class=""highlight"">lack of progress</span> on, among other issues, <span class=""highlight"">shared vision</span> and various approaches. She called for consensus text with clear options for ministers."

Highlighting the relevance of interlinkages, VENEZUELA suggested considering various approaches together with other interlinked issues under the AWG-KP and CMP, such as CDM continuation. Egypt, for the ARAB GROUP, supported by CHINA, encouraged the AWG-LCA Chair to prepare a revised text. INDIA and ARGENTINA noted that text on response measures did not adequately reflect parties' submissions.</span>"

redd,"Many parties queried the working methodology and status of the texts presented, with many calling for predictability concerning the issues that will be addressed, and meeting times. AWG-LCA Chair Tayeb clarified that negotiations on the AWG-LCA agreed outcome will continue in a single open-ended group and that in those areas where progress was still within reach, such as developed and developing country mitigation and <span class=""highlight"">REDD</span>+, break-out groups will meet again."
business,"As negotiators were going about their <span class=""highlight"">business</span> in an attempt to achieve a successful outcome for Friday, high-level discussions also continued both during informal ministerial roundtables and behind-the-scenes consultations. The COP President's informal stocktaking plenary in the evening provided an overview of informal ministerial outreach on key issues. UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon also reportedly met with many of the key players and, in his ministerial roundtable speech, announced plans to convene a meeting of world leaders in 2014 to help build political momentum for 2015 when parties are scheduled to conclude negotiations under the ADP. Noting that this kind of high-level engagement helped achieve what many considered successful outcomes in Cancun and Durban, one experienced negotiator opined: I really hope our ministers can step in and once again save the day. Some in the corridors commented on the evident urgency of the task, given the news of deaths and destruction caused by <span class=""highlight"">typhoon</span> Bopha raging in the Philippines."
second commitment period,"Algeria, for the G-77/CHINA, highlighted three main pillars of a Doha outcome: an ambitious <span class=""highlight"">second commitment period</span> that would allow for a higher level of ambition from all Annex I parties; finance under the AWG- LCA; and a balanced treatment of all elements under the ADP."

On the possibility of Annex B parties strengthening their <span class=""highlight"">QELROs</span> during the <span class=""highlight"">second commitment period</span>, the EU indicated willingness to explore the ambition mechanism proposed by the G-77/China.

He expressed <span class=""highlight"">solidarity</span> with the people of the Philippines, as did BOLIVIA, who stated that the current situation in that country is a testimony of what can be expected to take place more frequently.

But I am here to say that coal must change rapidly and dramatically for everyoneÃ¢Â€Â™s sake.Ã¢Â€Â"

As delegates packed into a meeting room, a delegate noted that while meeting rooms, rather than plenaries, facilitate an interactive environment, this can come at the expense of inclusiveness, as Ã¢Â€Âœonly those who arrive first will get a seat at the table, and the chance to speak,Ã¢Â€Â while another liked the arrangement, which, to him, is Ã¢Â€Âœreminiscent of indabas.Ã¢Â€Â Several noted the Ã¢Â€ÂœunenviableÃ¢Â€Â task of the Co-Chairs to pen the first ADP draft decision, which some called a Ã¢Â€Âœbare minimum,Ã¢Â€Â and others described as Ã¢Â€Âœa useful start.Ã¢Â€Â Another delegate seemed pleased with the buzz in the room, in contrast to what he perceived as a Ã¢Â€Âœcomplete lack of urgencyÃ¢Â€Â in the negotiations last week. With ministers in town, and Ã¢Â€Âœdecision timeÃ¢Â€Â in the ADP imminent, it remains to be seen if this timid hopefulness is here to stay."

NORWAY noted its support for the proposal by the Chair and said that methodologies were available to work on the basis of <span class=""highlight"">six GHGs</span>. CHINA reiterated the G-77/ChinaÂ’s preference for a <span class=""highlight"">gas</span>-by-<span class=""highlight"">gas</span> approach. SWITZERLAND said that it originally made a proposal based on <span class=""highlight"">three GHGs</span>, but favored the inclusion of <span class=""highlight"">all GHGs</span> not covered by the <span class=""highlight"">Montreal Protocol</span>, including <span class=""highlight"">HFCs</span>, <span class=""highlight"">PFCs</span>, and <span class=""highlight"">SF6</span>. POLAND suggested that additional GHGs could be included at a later stage.

intergovernmental panel on climate change|land-use change|land use|lulucf|forestry|sink|qelros|base year,"The Chair of the informal group on <span class=""highlight"">sinks</span>, Antonio La ViÃ±a, (the Philippines) reported that the group had worked on a proposal containing four options. According to the first one, <span class=""highlight"">QELROs</span> should be calculated on a net-net basis, i.e., all sources minus all <span class=""highlight"">sinks</span> in both the <span class=""highlight"">base year</span> and the target year for the first budget period; the second option proposes that a <span class=""highlight"">sink</span> category called <span class=""highlight"">land use</span> change and <span class=""highlight"">forestry</span> (<span class=""highlight"">LUCF</span>) not be considered for the establishment of <span class=""highlight"">QELROs</span> in the first budget period, but provides for the <span class=""highlight"">IPCC</span> to improve methodologies geared to the inclusion of <span class=""highlight"">LUCF</span> during the second budget period. The third option proposes the exclusion of <span class=""highlight"">LUCF</span> for the establishment of <span class=""highlight"">QELROs</span>, with the proviso that they be included at a later stage by the Meeting of the Parties (MOP) on the basis of new modalities and revised <span class=""highlight"">IPCC</span> methods. Under the fourth option, the establishment of <span class=""highlight"">QELROs</span> excludes the <span class=""highlight"">LUCF</span> category, but allows GHG removal by new activities to be counted towards compliance if verifiable. The new activities would be defined on the basis of advice from the <span class=""highlight"">IPCC</span> and agreed upon by the COP."
scientific uncertainty|uncertainties,"The informal group Chair noted that while Parties acknowledged the importance of <span class=""highlight"">sinks</span>, they discussed <span class=""highlight"">scientific uncertainties regarding sinksÂ’ GHG absorption capacity, and methodologies used to calculate this. He noted that options 3 and 4 might serve as basis for a compromise solution, considering the marked divergence of views on options 1 and 2.</span>"
qelros,"CHINA drew attention to the fact that budget periods appeared under each of the options, and recalled the G-77/ChinaÂ’s objection to this concept. BRAZIL and ICELAND indicated that the issue of <span class=""highlight"">sinks</span> needed to be sorted out before settling targets for <span class=""highlight"">QELROs</span>. BRAZIL noted the value of the third option as a basis for compromise. It was agreed that consultations on the matter would continue during COP-3."
policies and measures|gasâ­by-gas|gas|economies in transition|flexibility|binding commitments|eit,"He called for compromise on <span class=""highlight"">policies and measures</span>, noting that some delegations are seeking a <span class=""highlight"">mandatory approach</span> while others want none. The EU said it had made considerable concessions in Bonn by simplifying proposals on which <span class=""highlight"">policies and measures</span> should be mandatory. EGYPT invited the Chair to present a balanced proposal. The RUSSIAN FEDERATION proposed a middle path consisting of national measures. He said the question of <span class=""highlight"">policies and measures</span> is linked to other issues including the <span class=""highlight"">basket</span> of <span class=""highlight"">gases</span> to be adopted and the level of <span class=""highlight"">flexibility</span> to be accorded to Russia and other countries with <span class=""highlight"">economies in transition</span>. He urged delegations to begin seeking compromise immediately and not to leave all the negotiating work to government ministers. The EU tabled a new proposal, stating that any signatory or Party not included in Annex 1 nor acting under Article 10 may notify the depository that it has opted to adopt and implement some or all of the <span class=""highlight"">policies and measures</span> and/or to participate in the coordination process referred to elsewhere in the protocol. The G-77/ CHINA objected to the inclusion of a reference to non- Annex I Parties."
qelros,"The AGBM Chair, Raul Estrada, is expected to take over the task of chairing the <span class=""highlight"">QELROs</span> working group during COP-3. The new role - together with his job of chairing the COW - will put Estrada in a key position to pursue his proactive approach to the negotiations and bring his influence to bear on the high level negotiations expected at the end of COP-3. At SundayÂ’s resumed AGBM meeting, Estrada demonstrated his ability to send clear signals to Parties pursing demands of others whose demands he views as unsustainable. Drawing attention to a document he commissioned on developing country efforts to address climate change, he called on those developed countries that have not fulfilled their existing commitments to take note."
business,"FCCC Executive Secretary Michael Zammit Cutajar noted that, at an estimated 10,000 attendants, COP-3 beats all records for participation in a meeting on climate change. He stressed that the focus of the Conference should be its end product. He noted that in a recent exchange of views with a group of <span class=""highlight"">business</span> people, one of them had suggested that there should be Â“no fudgeÂ” in the Kyoto agreement."
industry,"The goals and the rules for attaining them should be clearly defined. He contrasted this approach with the propaganda from certain <span class=""highlight"">industrial sectors</span> that unashamedly plays games with the science and statistics of climate change.Â” He said that Â“in the present constellation of economic and political power, it is those who have already built their strength - often through unsustainable economic growth - who must lead the way towards a sustainable future,Â” and called for a clear, binding and verifiable commitment by industrialized countries to reduce their <span class=""highlight"">emissions</span> below <span class=""highlight"">1990 levels</span> early in the next century."
vulnerable|most vulnerable,"The G-77/CHINA noted that developing countries are the most <span class=""highlight"">vulnerable</span> to climate change and the least able to adapt, and are committed to modify trends in human-induced <span class=""highlight"">emissions</span> through the principle of common but <span class=""highlight"">differentiated responsibility</span>. The delay between production of <span class=""highlight"">emissions</span> and their effects requires Annex I countries to take the first steps and they should be blamed if Kyoto fails."

The EU reiterated its position favoring: a 15% cut in <span class=""highlight"">emissions</span> by developed countries, jointly or individually, by 2010; specific <span class=""highlight"">policies and measures</span> (<span class=""highlight"">P&amp;Ms</span>); and consideration of new <span class=""highlight"">commitments for developing</span> countries under Article 7.1(a) in the future. The RUSSIAN FEDERATION reiterated its proposal that each Annex I country consolidate its <span class=""highlight"">emissions</span> into aggregate Â“<span class=""highlight"">carbon dioxide</span> equivalentsÂ” with the obligations of each Annex I country set out in an attachment and determined according to Annex B. The US favored a target based on <span class=""highlight"">all GHGs</span>, sources, and <span class=""highlight"">sinks</span>, <span class=""highlight"">flexibility</span>, and meaningful participation of key developing countries. She offered <span class=""highlight"">flexibility</span> on limited, carefully bounded differentiation and proposed a working group to examine differentiation, including the Russian proposal. She noted concerns regarding the EU proposal for restrictions on <span class=""highlight"">emissions</span> trading, the EU's target in light of its economic advantage under their <span class=""highlight"">bubble</span> proposal, the breadth of differentiation implied, and EU member state accountability. She favored different targets for developing countries, such as <span class=""highlight"">emissions</span> growth targets. Developing countries that assume voluntary commitments under the proposed Article 10 could gain new resources and <span class=""highlight"">technology</span> through <span class=""highlight"">emissions</span> trading."

He noted that the group reached two conclusions: the MCP should be advisory rather than supervisory in nature and AG13 should not complete its work until after COP-3. He said there are still questions remaining: whether Article 13 requires a process or committee; who may <span class=""highlight"">trigger</span> the regime; and whether the MCP should provide assistance to developing countries or consultative advice to all countries. COP-3 noted the report of AG13 and adopted a draft decision that enabled the AG13 to continue its work."
commitments for non-annex i|differentiated responsibilities|emission,"The G-77/CHINA, supported by INDIA, BRAZIL, CHINA, MALAYSIA, SAUDI ARABIA, EGYPT, INDONESIA and AOSIS, objected to discussing evolution of commitments. He noted the FCCC strikes a careful balance on review of commitments only for Annex I Parties, under the principle of common but <span class=""highlight"">differentiated responsibilities</span>. The commitments developed countries made in Rio have not been honored, nor are proposals for the protocol likely to match scientific recommendations. Instead, attempts are being made to introduce <span class=""highlight"">commitments for non-Annex I</span> Parties. INDIA cited the decision of COP-1 that the <span class=""highlight"">Berlin Mandate</span> be confined to reviewing the commitments of Annex I countries on strengthening developed countriesÂ’ commitments to GHG reductions and operationalization of resources transfer. He agreed with the AGBM reportÂ’s conclusion that the evolution clause contravenes the <span class=""highlight"">Berlin Mandate</span>. BRAZIL noted that its proposal is useful, while the evolution clause is an extraneous distraction from the main purpose of reducing the <span class=""highlight"">emissions</span> of the main Annex I polluters. CHINA said the evolution proposal is: outside the scope of the <span class=""highlight"">Berlin Mandate</span> process, which prevails until its outcome is adopted at COP-3; a political move to let some countries evade their responsibilities; intended to destroy the FCCCÂ’s principle of common but <span class=""highlight"">differentiated responsibilities</span>; and intended to lead to the failure of COP- 3."
technology|technology transfer,"MALAYSIA compared developed countriesÂ’ inability to make meaningful commitments in 1992 to their current lack of good faith over commitments for the period after 2000, and noted they have also failed to fulfill their commitments on transfer of <span class=""highlight"">technology</span>."
bubble|qelros,"The US delegation reportedly surprised the EU, not to mention a number of observers, with a call for a working group to look more closely at differentiation, including Russia's proposal, sometimes known as the big <span class=""highlight"">bubble</span>. The US statement raised the prospect that a variation of big <span class=""highlight"">bubble</span> could surface in the <span class=""highlight"">QELROs</span> negotiations. While some observers view the <span class=""highlight"">development</span> as a possible way out for the US, permitting each party to choose its own reduction target, it is thought to be too early to judge the overall significance of this <span class=""highlight"">development</span>. As it stands, the Russian formulation would transform the EU 15 percent reduction into a unilateral pledge, something the Europeans are expected to resist. Some participants predict that the EU may have to give some ground on differentiation."

The group on <span class=""highlight"">QELROs</span> will deal with Article 3 of the negotiating text, methodologies, <span class=""highlight"">emissions</span> trading, <span class=""highlight"">joint implementation</span> and annexes. Two groups are to discuss coverage and differentiation, a group on financial issues will also discuss the proposal for a clean <span class=""highlight"">development</span> <span class=""highlight"">fund</span>, and two groups would consider institutions and mechanisms and advancing commitments under Article 4.1.

qelros,"The negotiating group on <span class=""highlight"">QELROs</span>, chaired by RaÃºl Estrada Oyuela (Argentina), met for the first time in the morning. Discussion focused mainly on budgets and differentiation. On budgets, one delegation explained once again its preference for the concept of the budget approach. A group of countries opposed the concept, saying that there was confusion between the terms Â“budget periodsÂ” and Â“<span class=""highlight"">emission</span> budgets.Â” As a way to alleviate confusion, one delegation proposed using the term Â“compliance periodÂ” within a paragraph on timing for <span class=""highlight"">QELROs</span>. A contact group was formed to consider language to describe the Â“budget/complianceÂ” period. There seemed to be increasing agreement that the range for the initial Â“budget periodÂ” should be five years. However, further negotiation will be needed to determine when it should begin."
1990 levels|emission|gas|qelros|flexibility|emissions trading|technology|energy,"Canada submitted a proposal on <span class=""highlight"">QELROs</span> consisting of a 3% reduction of GHGs below <span class=""highlight"">1990 levels</span> by the year 2010. It also provides for an additional reduction of 5% by 2015, and indicates that the years 2010 and 2015 refer to the mid-point years of budget periods. CanadaÂ’s objective is a protocol that provides for comprehensive coverage, including <span class=""highlight"">sinks</span> and six greenhouse <span class=""highlight"">gases</span>, and maximum <span class=""highlight"">flexibility</span> in its implementation. <span class=""highlight"">Flexibility</span> would entail measures such as <span class=""highlight"">emissions</span> trading and the banking and borrowing of <span class=""highlight"">emissions</span> budgets. Canada said <span class=""highlight"">joint implementation</span> with credits offers the best combination of <span class=""highlight"">technology</span> and financial transfer to developing countries and expressed the hope that developing countries would see its potential value. He also called for recognition of the potential contribution of other measures, including the export of <span class=""highlight"">energy</span> with <span class=""highlight"">low carbon</span> content."
emission|bubble,"Canada said that delegates must come away from Kyoto confident that key developing countries, especially those whose <span class=""highlight"">emissions</span> are large and growing, will ultimately be part of a processs leading to a solution. Developing countries should take care not to feed ammunition to those people who would cite their arguments as an excuse for doing nothing. Canada stated that equivalency of effort is an important objective if their target must be Â“soldÂ” domestically. An acceptable way to appropriately recognize <span class=""highlight"">national circumstances</span> must be found, and differentiated targets could be included. He said that while the EUÂ’s wish to act jointly is understandable, he remains unpersuaded that this approach would be equitable. A major problem inherent in the EU Â“<span class=""highlight"">bubble</span>Â” approach is its allowance for wide differentiation of targets within the EU, while denying differentiation to others. The effect of future additions of EU member states also presents a problem."

Industrialized nations favored alternative text under which all Parties would, inter alia, implement national and regional programmes containing measures to mitigate climate change and facilitate adequate adaptation. Developing countries preferred an alternative stating that developed countries shall incorporate <span class=""highlight"">QELROs</span> and <span class=""highlight"">P&amp;Ms</span> into their national programmes. Developed countries would also specify measure taken to finance <span class=""highlight"">technology</span> transfer, provide <span class=""highlight"">financial resources</span> and assist in meeting the costs of adaptation."

The draft would set <span class=""highlight"">QELROs</span> on gross <span class=""highlight"">emissions</span> and measure compliance with net <span class=""highlight"">emissions</span>. It refers to verifiable changes . . . resulting from direct human induced <span class=""highlight"">land-use</span> change and <span class=""highlight"">forestry</span> activities since 1990 to achieve compliance.

They debated the meaning of a number of terms included in the Chair's draft, with some noting that new and direct appeared vague. Concern was also raised with the reference to 1990 as a <span class=""highlight"">base year</span>.

qelros,"The EC said that there was growing consensus regarding a 5- year time frame for Â“budget periods,Â” but indicated that further consultations were needed to determine when the first budget period would begin. He spoke of differentiation based on a 0 - 5% range of <span class=""highlight"">reductions of emissions.

The aggressive tone was joined in the corridors by comments that the EU could not sustain a 15 percent target were it not for large <span class=""highlight"">emissions</span> reductions unmotivated by climate change concerns and its refusal so far to address all <span class=""highlight"">gases</span>. EU representatives called the critique of the <span class=""highlight"">bubble</span> a tactic, but some NGOs said the vehemence of the criticisms compelled them to come to the EU's defense because, they said, the EU wasn't defending itself. Some observers suggested that a greater threat to the EU's coordination of a group position may be ongoing informal courtship of some EU members by proponents of competing <span class=""highlight"">QELROs</span> proposals."
qelros,"A day after the USÂ’ expression of interest in differentiation, this hurdle to an agreement may be receding in discussions within the <span class=""highlight"">QELROs</span> group. Some participants say that a narrow band of differentiation could make deeper cuts palatable for some countries, resulting in a greater aggregate reduction in global <span class=""highlight"">emissions</span> than otherwise possible. Others would be satisfied if it at least makes it possible to reach an agreement that all countries can live with. Some participants worried, however, about the impact of an agreement based on differentiated targets. Pleas were heard that differentiation not become a loophole, as was the fear that providing a Â“floor to ceilingÂ” range would encourage countries to head for the floor."

She called for action from developed countries consistent with Agenda 21, the FCCC and previous COP resolutions, and recommended that that the issue be taken up as a separate item at COP-4. SOUTH AFRICA said access to <span class=""highlight"">technology</span> and <span class=""highlight"">transfer of technical</span> <span class=""highlight"">know-how</span> would play a crucial role in meeting the <span class=""highlight"">energy</span> implications of moving towards sustainable <span class=""highlight"">development</span>.

The first <span class=""highlight"">basket</span> (<span class=""highlight"">CO2</span>, <span class=""highlight"">CH4</span> and <span class=""highlight"">N2O</span>) would be subject to <span class=""highlight"">QELROs</span> immediately, while proposals for formulating <span class=""highlight"">QELROs</span> for the second <span class=""highlight"">basket</span> (<span class=""highlight"">HFCs</span>, <span class=""highlight"">PFCs</span> and <span class=""highlight"">SF6</span>) would be debated at COP-4."
adaptation and response measures|mitigation and adaptation,"ARTICLE 4.1:The negotiating group on commitments under Article 4.1 met in the afternoon to discuss a Chair's draft text. Delegates agreed not to discuss three reformulated paragraphs in the draft, covering national and regional programmes for <span class=""highlight"">GHG inventories</span> and mitigation and <span class=""highlight"">adaptation measures</span>, actions to address climate change, and reporting, after a group of countries said it preferred to base discussions on the prior version of those paragraphs."

A regional group suggested combining the first two sentences of separate options on <span class=""highlight"">technology</span> transfer and deleting the remaining text of both. Some Parties expressed concern over text on removing barriers to <span class=""highlight"">investment</span> in <span class=""highlight"">technology</span> transfer. A group of countries suggested adding the phrase developed country Parties shall to paragraphs regarding <span class=""highlight"">technology</span> transfer, but some developed countries objected."
qelros,"Delegates to the Third Conference of the Parties (COP-3) to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (FCCC) met in negotiating groups in the morning and afternoon.

The Committee of the Whole (COW) met in an evening stock-taking Plenary session."
gas|emission|qelros|eit|economies in transition,"Chair RaÃºl Estrada Oyuela (Argentina) indicated that considerable progress had been made on some elements of <span class=""highlight"">QELROs</span>, while the more difficult ones remain to be solved during the high-level segment. He reported agreement on text for Articles 3.3 and 3.4 on commitments for countries with <span class=""highlight"">economies in transition</span> and for Article 11 on periodic review of the implementation of the Protocol. He informed delegates that a paragraph on <span class=""highlight"">emissions</span> borrowing (Article 3.14) was eliminated, and that a draft decision on methodologies for estimation of GHGs is to be recommended for adoption by the COP. On outstanding issues, he indicated that informal consultations had served to identify options on coverage of <span class=""highlight"">gases</span> and on baskets. He said that an option listing <span class=""highlight"">gases</span> separately was still open, and added that he would prepare a text on coverage of <span class=""highlight"">gases</span> based on the discussions."
qelros,"Luis Gylvan Meira Filho (Brazil) reported on the informal consultations he had conducted on Â“multi-year targets,Â” formerly known as Â“budgets.Â” He stated that problems during the discussion arose from the meaning of the word Â“budget.Â” Some delegations indicated confusion between the terms Â“<span class=""highlight"">emission</span> budgetsÂ” and Â“budget periods.Â” To solve the problem, these were replaced with Â“total <span class=""highlight"">emissions</span>Â” and Â“commitment periodsÂ” respectively. He indicated that a text on <span class=""highlight"">QELROs</span> reflecting these changes was available. He said there was increasing agreement that the range for Â“commitment periodsÂ” should be five years. Chair Estrada added that using the term Â“multi-year targetsÂ” had no implications for PartiesÂ’ obligation to submit national communications on an annual basis. The US, supported by NEW ZEALAND, said that the term Â“total <span class=""highlight"">emissions</span>Â” does not fully encompass the meaning of the word Â“budget,Â” and noted the need to further reflect on the meaning of the term where it appeared in other parts of the text."

The first paragraph states that Annex I Parties shall ensure that their [gross] aggregate anthropogenic <span class=""highlight"">carbon dioxide</span> equivalent <span class=""highlight"">emissions</span> do not exceed their commitments. The second bracketed paragraph discusses net [changes in] <span class=""highlight"">GHG emissions from sources and removals by sinks resulting from direct human induced land- use change and forestry activities. It lists three options. Options A refers to variable changes in stocks. Option B refers to verifiable changes in stocks [up to xx per cent] of the QELROs. Option C is limited to afforestation, reforestation, deforestation, and harvesting since 1990 measured as verifiable changes in stocks used to meet QELROs. A third paragraph states that the MOP shall determine how and which human induced activities related to GHG emissions and removals in the land-use change and forestry activities category shall contribute to meeting QELROs commitments.</span>"
greenhouse gas emissions|emission|co2|uncertainties|qelros,"Chair Estrada observed that other issues are pending decision on <span class=""highlight"">QELROs</span> and that definitions were needed. He said that not everyone would be happy but it is time to decide. AUSTRALIA proposed a new option for a fully comprehensive approach. She advocated a net approach and suggested that the other options would introduce inequities between countries, along with <span class=""highlight"">uncertainty</span>. The new Australian text, with support from the RUSSIAN FEDERATION, provides for Annex I Parties to ensure that their net anthropogenic <span class=""highlight"">carbon dioxide</span> equivalent <span class=""highlight"">emissions</span> as listed in Annex A do not exceed their commitments in terms of <span class=""highlight"">emission</span> budgets/target year, inscribed in Attachment I. It further states that the verifiable net <span class=""highlight"">GHG emissions from sources and removals by sinks in terms of carbon dioxide equivalents resulting from direct human-induced activities shall be used to meet the QELROs commitments of each Party in Annex I, and provides for reporting in a transparent and verifiable manner.</span>"

JAPAN said his basic approach continues to be the gross approach. He recalled that the <span class=""highlight"">IPCC</span> Chair Emeritus, Bert Bolin, had raised problems concerning <span class=""highlight"">sinks</span>. If Parties deny <span class=""highlight"">uncertainties</span>, their entire effort to work out appropriate targets would lose its justification. He supported <span class=""highlight"">Option C</span>. CANADA said <span class=""highlight"">Option C</span> does not cover conservation of currently managed <span class=""highlight"">forests</span> or agrarian practices and provides no incentive for <span class=""highlight"">biodiversity</span>. BARBADOS supported <span class=""highlight"">Option C</span>. The US said his own preference would be similar to the Australian proposal. He said <span class=""highlight"">Option C</span> was limited, and Â“<span class=""highlight"">forest</span> management and <span class=""highlight"">forest</span> conservationÂ” should be added. The UK commented on the complex mathematical issues raised by choosing either a gross or net approach and their implications. He suggested that it was going to be extremely problematic to negotiate the question, and the issue may have to be resolved politically."

BRAZIL, supported by COSTA RICA, favored <span class=""highlight"">Option C</span> as in the original ChairÂ’s text, or dropping the whole Article. ICELAND, URUGUAY, CANADA, MEXICO, COSTA RICA and NEW ZEALAND supported the USÂ’s concern that <span class=""highlight"">Option C</span> refers to only a limited number of activities that can contribute to <span class=""highlight"">sinks</span>. URUGUAY proposed adding Â“<span class=""highlight"">forest</span> management, <span class=""highlight"">reforestation</span> and any other <span class=""highlight"">forestry</span> activity.Â” MEXICO suggested Â“<span class=""highlight"">forest</span> management and <span class=""highlight"">forest</span> conservationÂ” and COSTA RICA proposed Â“natural <span class=""highlight"">forest</span> regeneration,Â” and cautioned against allowing <span class=""highlight"">sink</span> activities to disappear during the review discussed in Paragraph 3. ICELAND called for giving Parties credit for the changes occurring during a target year or budget period. NORWAY, supported by NEW ZEALAND, added brackets around Â“since 1990Â” in <span class=""highlight"">Option C</span>, as in Options A and B. GRENADA queried how to measure 1990 <span class=""highlight"">sinks</span> now if not already done and suggested giving a negative credit to countries when <span class=""highlight"">sinks</span> are destroyed. ARGENTINA supported <span class=""highlight"">Option C</span>, noting its relationship to <span class=""highlight"">forest</span> conservation, the Convention to Combat <span class=""highlight"">Desertification</span> and recovery of soils."
sink|forest|forest conservation|forest management|option c,"The Chair suggested that <span class=""highlight"">Option C</span> appeared ready for consensus, evoking neither passionate support nor strong opposition. It is clearly a text to limit or set parameters to <span class=""highlight"">sinks</span>. He said delegates would have to take US comments and their support into account, although definitions related to <span class=""highlight"">forest</span> management could be a task for SBSTA. There was clear resistance to this option, but he felt the COW was ready to accept <span class=""highlight"">Option C</span>, adding <span class=""highlight"">forest</span> management and <span class=""highlight"">forest</span> conservation."

VENEZUELA said the US amendments would reduce its reluctance regarding <span class=""highlight"">Option C</span>. URUGUAY said the US amendments sought sustainable <span class=""highlight"">development</span>. CANADA supported the modified <span class=""highlight"">Option C</span>, as did HONDURAS, who supported Iceland on including soil productivity. BRAZIL and SAMOA expressed strong disagreement, SAMOA preferring to bracket <span class=""highlight"">deforestation</span> or harvesting.

sink|forest|forest conservation|forest management,"The Chair noted clear reaction against <span class=""highlight"">forest</span> management and <span class=""highlight"">forest</span> conservation. He asked whether the US could support only management. The US said the choice on <span class=""highlight"">sinks</span> will have an enormous impact on a number. He said it was also necessary to ensure the numbers for <span class=""highlight"">sinks</span> were transparent and verifiable."
sink|forest|forest management|option c,"The MARSHALL ISLANDS said he was not prepared to let Annex I Parties take credit for what nature is doing. He said he could not accept <span class=""highlight"">Option C</span> without further consultations. The EU said the paragraph should remain bracketed for ministers. BARBADOS did not support <span class=""highlight"">Option C</span>. PERU supported <span class=""highlight"">Option C</span> but expressed doubts regarding methodology for <span class=""highlight"">forest</span> management. GRENADA did not understand how conservation of <span class=""highlight"">forests</span> improves the uptake of a <span class=""highlight"">sink</span>.

BRAZIL said the question is: what are man-made activities for which credits should be given to increase <span class=""highlight"">emissions</span>? He compared the 6 gigatonnes (Gt) of carbon emitted from fossil <span class=""highlight"">fuel</span> and 1 Gt from <span class=""highlight"">land use</span> change to natural uptake of 2 Gt by <span class=""highlight"">oceans</span> and 2 Gt on continental surfaces. Given deep economic limitations and the inclusion of all countries, if all <span class=""highlight"">forests</span> are considered managed this would grant a license for 30 percent more <span class=""highlight"">emissions</span>.

He proposed double conditionality: Annex I Parties need early agreement by non-Annex I countries on <span class=""highlight"">future commitments</span>, but non- Annex I Parties would not be held to commitments if Annex I Parties do not fulfil their Kyoto commitments. He called for progressive engagement according to relative levels of <span class=""highlight"">development</span>, and exemption for <span class=""highlight"">least developed countries</span>. Supported by HUNGARY, the US, CANADA, the EU, POLAND, SLOVENIA, AUSTRALIA, SWITZERLAND, and JAPAN, he introduced a draft text that, inter alia: notes Annex I Party commitments through 2014; considers that future <span class=""highlight"">Annex I commitments</span> beyond that date should comprise the widest possible participation in binding action; recognizes the dependence of inception of non-Annex I PartiesÂ’ <span class=""highlight"">legally binding</span> <span class=""highlight"">emissions</span> limitations commitments on Annex I Parties' implementation, particularly of <span class=""highlight"">Kyoto Protocol</span> <span class=""highlight"">QELROs</span>; agrees there should be further <span class=""highlight"">QELROs</span> for Annex I Parties and Â“quantified <span class=""highlight"">emission</span> limitation objectivesÂ” for other Parties, except <span class=""highlight"">least developed countries</span>; and establishes a process to set the commitments, to be concluded by 2002."

This is not the time to address developing country commitments, but to strengthen developed country commitments. He concluded with one word: no. INDIA objected to depriving developing countries of equitable environmental room to grow. BRAZIL said one developed country statement had implied if you don't deliver, we won't deliver, to which he replied until you deliver, we don't discuss.

Still others wondered whether the proposal might have been placed to cast discussion of voluntary <span class=""highlight"">non-Annex I commitments in a comparatively favorable light. An authoritative observer suggested that the presentation's greatest problem might have been in contradicting its own sequential premise: that a clear picture of Annex I QELROs must emerge before a sober consideration of developing country commitments.</span>"

qelros,"Luis Gylvan Meira Filho (Brazil) introduced a revised draft text relating to multi-year targets. The text provides an additional definition to be added to Article 1, stating that a defined amount means the amount of net aggregate <span class=""highlight"">emissions</span> a Party may not exceed in a given commitment period in order to meet its <span class=""highlight"">QELROs</span>. The revised text also contains three alternatives for the first paragraph of Article 3 (commitments)."

The second alternative emphasizes that allocation of <span class=""highlight"">emissions</span> under the <span class=""highlight"">bubble</span> would be <span class=""highlight"">legally binding</span>.

Both contain a bracketed reference to [establishment of measurements of <span class=""highlight"">compensation</span>]. The US, the EU, POLAND, AUSTRALIA, and CANADA said <span class=""highlight"">compensation</span> was unacceptable and the paragraph should be deleted. SAUDI ARABIA, the G- 77/CHINA, INDONESIA, UGANDA, URUGUAY, KUWAIT, NIGERIA, the UNITED ARAB EMIRATES, CHINA, VENEZUELA, BAHRAIN and EGYPT supported removing the brackets. ZIMBABWE suggested ministerial consideration of the proposal under FCCC Article 4.8. NEW ZEALAND objected to <span class=""highlight"">compensation</span>, but supported Uganda's proposal to replace <span class=""highlight"">compensation</span> with impacts. The Chair suggested replacing the existing paragraph with Iran's text, with the entire text bracketed."

The first paragraph indicates that the implementation of Article 12 shall take into account FCCC provisions on <span class=""highlight"">financial resources</span> and the <span class=""highlight"">vulnerability</span> of developing countries to climate change. The second paragraph states that developed country Parties to the Convention, Â“in accordance with Articles 4.3 and 11 of the ConventionÂ” shall provide <span class=""highlight"">financial resources</span> to meet agreed <span class=""highlight"">full costs</span> incurred by developing country Parties in formulating national communications, and to meet the agreed full incremental costs of implementing measures such as national communications, inventories of GHGs, collection of data and adaptation of <span class=""highlight"">new technologies</span>. A third paragraph states that previous decisions by the COP on the <span class=""highlight"">financial mechanism</span>, shall apply mutatis mutandis to this article. A fourth paragraph indicates that developing country Parties can avail themselves of <span class=""highlight"">financial resources</span> for the implementation of Article 12, through bilateral, regional or other multilateral channels. The PHILIPPINES, supported by SAUDI ARABIA, CHINA and PERU requested more time for the G-77/China to consult on the text because of the links between this paragraph and other outstanding issues, particularly those referring to the advancement of commitments under Article 4.1."
sink|reforestation,"On <span class=""highlight"">sinks</span>, Chair Estrada asked for informal consultations to consider several questions including, inter alia, a proposal that a subsidiary body could work on <span class=""highlight"">sinks</span> in June 1998, and report to COP-4 prior to <span class=""highlight"">entry into force</span> of the protocol. The RUSSIAN FEDERATION said the nature of the issueÂ’s resolution would determine his view of the protocol. The MARSHALL ISLANDS, COSTA RICA and URUGUAY said they were ready to adopt the existing draft text. CANADA said there is an inconsistency in the proposalÂ’s treatment of harvesting, which would cause Canada Â“enormous pain,Â” and <span class=""highlight"">reforestation</span>, which would not offset the penalty from harvesting. MEXICO asked the Chair to include conservation activities in the consideration of a definition of <span class=""highlight"">sinks</span>. Chair Estrada said that the necessary analysis and definitions were not yet available. The US said the text might not be resolved until calculations regarding targets had been completed. Chair Estrada said his suggested definitions would point to lower numbers. It was best to be clear and transparent on what Parties were planning to do and adopt common standards. The EU urged caution to avoid perverse incentives."

JAPAN, BARBADOS, RUSSIA, the US, CANADA, CUBA and JAMAICA supported the text. NEW ZEALAND, supported by AUSTRALIA, the US and NORWAY, called for an earlier text to be kept as an option for ministers. The Chair noted that the text had not been formally introduced, but agreed to keep it as a source. The MARSHALL ISLANDS, SWITZERLAND, BARBADOS and MALAYSIA objected. The US proposed adding Â“for the first commitment periodÂ” to a paragraph on when <span class=""highlight"">sink</span> activities would be allowed. The EU put the whole paragraph in brackets.

He supported: the three plus three <span class=""highlight"">gas</span> proposal; trading only with strong targets and <span class=""highlight"">domestic action</span>, monitoring, sanctions and market safeguards; and <span class=""highlight"">JI</span> with rules and safeguards. He said mandatory internationally coordinated <span class=""highlight"">P&amp;Ms</span>; are indispensable.

Mobilizing new and additional resources through the <span class=""highlight"">financial mechanism</span> could foster voluntary limitation of developing country GHG <span class=""highlight"">emissions</span>."
emission|all gases,"Many speakers focused on elements necessary for a Kyoto agreement. SAMOA, for AOSIS and supported by NIUE, stated that a Kyoto agreement must contain strong, short- and medium-term targets for Annex I Parties and a mechanism for early review of their adequacy. NORWAY said developed countries must agree on an overall reduction target for the <span class=""highlight"">emission</span> of <span class=""highlight"">all GHGs</span> of 10 to 15% by 2010.

SWITZERLAND and NORWAY supported <span class=""highlight"">joint implementation</span> (<span class=""highlight"">JI</span>) once modalities are agreed, but developed countries should not circumvent reduction objectives. RUSSIA said <span class=""highlight"">JI</span> and <span class=""highlight"">emissions</span> trading could foster partnership between developed and developing nations. CANADA said <span class=""highlight"">flexibility</span> is needed to adjust to changes required for implementation and cost-effective reductions."

RUSSIA, supported by NORWAY, UKRAINE, AUSTRALIA and ICELAND, proposed text setting a collective Annex I net aggregate <span class=""highlight"">CO2</span> equivalent <span class=""highlight"">emissions</span> objective, with annexes for individual Parties' objectives. The US expressed interest. Chair Estrada said he would not discuss proposals without numbers. The G- 77/CHINA said the proposal delayed the discussion of numbers. TRINIDAD and TOBAGO, with TUVALU, said the annexes would be problematic. The UK did not support the proposal without numbers."

The US proposed counting <span class=""highlight"">emissions</span> on a net basis but discounting 75% of <span class=""highlight"">emissions</span> from <span class=""highlight"">sinks</span> in the first commitment period. Chair Estrada said sources and <span class=""highlight"">sinks</span> should not be selected to disguise what is being decided. He asked delegates to be sincere for 48 hours."

Recalling his three plus three proposal, he suggested a different <span class=""highlight"">base year</span> for the second <span class=""highlight"">basket</span>. The US, supported by NEW ZEALAND, proposed 1995. RUSSIA suggested dealing with the six <span class=""highlight"">gases</span> <span class=""highlight"">basket</span> in the <span class=""highlight"">second commitment period</span>. ICELAND, supported by NORWAY and the EU, objected to the US proposal because some countries had already made efforts to reduce their <span class=""highlight"">emission</span> of <span class=""highlight"">gases</span> in the second <span class=""highlight"">basket</span>. NORWAY asked whether those Parties with sufficient 1990 data on the <span class=""highlight"">gases</span> in the proposed second <span class=""highlight"">basket</span> could proceed with a full <span class=""highlight"">basket</span> approach. INDIA said the G- 77/CHINA wished to revisit the issue after announcements on <span class=""highlight"">QELROs</span> numbers."
qelros|emissions trading,"CANADA, suppported by NEW ZEALAND, RUSSIA and the US, asked that its <span class=""highlight"">emissions</span> trading text be substituted for Article 6, noting its guidelines and a section assigning responsibility to Parties for all transactions, including those by intermediaries. The G-77/CHINA and URUGUAY requested deletion of the article, but said the text could remain under consideration. He said the core issue is the numbers. Chair Estrada said he failed to see how the proposal reduces <span class=""highlight"">emissions</span>. TOGO, supported by MALAYSIA, proposed adjourning until numbers were proposed. NEW ZEALAND said resolving trading would allow progress on commitments. CHINA replied that until <span class=""highlight"">QELROs</span> are resolved, the protocol is meaningless."
emission|gas|qelros|flexibility|emissions trading,"The US said its number is a package, depending on what <span class=""highlight"">gases</span> are included, how <span class=""highlight"">sinks</span> count, and what kinds of <span class=""highlight"">flexibility</span> are available. If there is no trading, the number changes. He proposed an additional paragraph extracted from Article 7 (<span class=""highlight"">Joint Implementation</span>) permitting projects between Annex 1 parties. The EU said the scope of <span class=""highlight"">flexibility</span>, including <span class=""highlight"">emissions</span> trading, was contingent upon <span class=""highlight"">QELROs</span> numbers. COLOMBIA said the ability to display <span class=""highlight"">flexibility</span> had just about run out among non-Annex I countries. SAMOA suggested that the provision of a range of numbers would assist the debate on <span class=""highlight"">emissions</span> trading. UKRAINE defended retaining Articles 6, 7 and 8 because they define the mechanisms for implementation. RUSSIA supported a proposal from the Chair to close discussion, and suggested a protocol between the EU and G-77/CHINA. UGANDA said there would be no free trading of <span class=""highlight"">emissions</span>. Chair Estrada announced his intention to produce a paper with a proposed final approach, with <span class=""highlight"">QELROs</span> numbers and positions. The deadline for Parties to deliver their own numbers would be 3:00 pm Tuesday."
qelros,"Pressure is building on Annex I countries to deliver their target numbers for <span class=""highlight"">QELROs</span> as negotiations go to the wire. Tensions emerged at a meeting of the newly formed extended Bureau Monday - a meeting of delegates and ministers described by one participant as a poker game where only half the players are in on the final deal. Developing country Parties had reportedly lost patience with industrialized countries determined to bring home a final package without consulting their significant others from the G-77/CHINA, now represented on the extended Bureau. This despite the expectation that after this complex endgame a number of key G-77 players are expected to participate meaningfully, having calculated their potential gains from incentives offered. So far, though, the only number coming out of the negotiations is Chair Estrada's 3 o'clock <span class=""highlight"">QELROs</span> deadline."

The <span class=""highlight"">QELROs</span> proposal was the global <span class=""highlight"">bubble</span> as suggested at different moments during the negotiations, in particular by Russia. The ChairÂ’s text contains a proposal amounting to a global reduction of 5 per cent in <span class=""highlight"">emissions</span> of <span class=""highlight"">CO2</span>, <span class=""highlight"">CH4</span>, NO2 from <span class=""highlight"">1990 levels</span>, for the commitment period between 2006 and 2010, with the possibility that Parties fulfil the commitment individually or jointly.

He said the global <span class=""highlight"">reduction commitment</span> had been distributed in a differentiated way, with some countries possibly increasing <span class=""highlight"">emissions</span>, others keeping their current levels, and most reducing. <span class=""highlight"">Afforestation</span>, <span class=""highlight"">reforestation</span> and <span class=""highlight"">deforestation</span> had been included as <span class=""highlight"">sinks</span>, with provision for further analysis. The text for draft Article 6 on <span class=""highlight"">emissions</span> trading was negotiated at AGBM-8 in Bonn. On Article 7, Chair Estrada said <span class=""highlight"">joint implementation</span> between Annex I and non-Annex I Parties had been dropped.

URUGUAY sought clarification on provision in Article 14 for Annex I Parties to use certificates of reductions accruing from <span class=""highlight"">CDM</span> projects to contribute to compliance Â“with part of theirÂ” <span class=""highlight"">QELROs</span> commitments. Meira Filho said there had been no full agreement on the text because a number of delegations thought that either a number should be specified in the text as a percentage of commitments or that the COP should determine a percentage representing a maximum of commitments that could be met using the <span class=""highlight"">CDM</span>. Others preferred a more general restriction. SAUDI ARABIA objected that an alternative text from Chair EstradaÂ’s negotiating text had been dropped. Chair Estrada said it was clear that the draft Article 14 did not reflect a consensus."

cdm|additionality|cdm projects|baselines|cost effectiveness,"Although there were no official conclusions, participants agreed that <span class=""highlight"">CDM</span> projects should achieve: sustainable <span class=""highlight"">development</span> objectives established by the host developing country; <span class=""highlight"">cost effective</span> <span class=""highlight"">emission</span> reductions for developed countries; and global <span class=""highlight"">GHG emission reductions. Key operational issues that need to be addressed in order to ensure credibility and effectiveness of CDM are: governance procedures; establishment of baselines and definitions of additionality; a good certification process; clear, transparent and consistent rules; and significant capacity building in developing countries in order for them to develop, implement and monitor CDM projects.</span>"
cdm|baselines|cdm projects|cers|funding,"Major unresolved issues include: <span class=""highlight"">equity</span> in the implementation of the <span class=""highlight"">CDM</span> (balance of benefits between Annex I and non-Annex I countries, balance of projects between regions in non-Annex I countries); clear definition of governance procedures, <span class=""highlight"">baselines</span> and the certification process; sharing of credits (percentage of <span class=""highlight"">CERs</span> between host and investor countries); interconnection between <span class=""highlight"">CDM</span> projects and national sustainable <span class=""highlight"">development</span> priorities; linkages with other cooperative mechanisms including a possible adaptation fee on all mechanisms and a cap on the use of these mechanisms in meeting Kyoto commitments; and more specificity with respect to capacity building to help develop and implement the <span class=""highlight"">CDM</span>--for what, for whom and using what <span class=""highlight"">funds</span>."
cers|cdm|kyoto protocol|emissions trading,"Participants also highlighted the following risks: devaluation of national commitments in Annex I countries or risk that the <span class=""highlight"">Kyoto Protocol</span> will not be ratified (creates a lower demand for <span class=""highlight"">CERs</span>); price of <span class=""highlight"">CERs</span> influenced by <span class=""highlight"">emissions</span> trading and other opportunities for cost-effective actions. Although no consensus was reached (or sought) participants expressed the view that they left the workshop with a better understanding of each other's views and concerns leading into COP- 4. This will enable negotiators to have fewer surprises and give them a head start on fixing priorities for work after COP- 4. The IEA and UNEP will be holding a side event at COP- 4 on 6 November from 1:00-3:00 pm to present the results of the regional <span class=""highlight"">CDM</span> workshops and inform negotiators of the main outcomes of this joint effort."
development|sustainable development,"Maria Julia Alsogaray, Secretary of Natural Resources and Sustainable <span class=""highlight"">Development</span> of Argentina, was elected President of COP-4. She noted that while Argentina was not one of the countries that has historic responsibilities for the climate change problem, it wished to belong to the group holding future responsibilities for commitment leading to a solution. She said she wanted COP-4 to signal a new momentum in the process and said an action plan for future work should be established here. While developing countries share the burden of responsibility in responding to this issue, they have an ethical duty to ensure sustainable <span class=""highlight"">development</span>."
technology|business|technology transfer|know-how,"Michael Zammit Cutajar, Executive Secretary of the FCCC, observed that this was the first COP to be held in a developing country. He anticipated that an action plan with ambitious and politically firm deadlines would be created as a result of this meeting. He noted that COP-4 presents an opportunity to revitalize the FCCC itself, perhaps through strengthening the transfer of <span class=""highlight"">technology</span> and <span class=""highlight"">know-how</span>, and <span class=""highlight"">financial support</span>. COP- 4 could mark the occasion where the <span class=""highlight"">business</span> community increased its role in combating climate change through efficient programs conducted in an equitable way."

He distinguished developing country Â“survival <span class=""highlight"">emissions</span>Â” from developed country Â“luxury <span class=""highlight"">emissions</span>,Â” and said developing countries risked losing <span class=""highlight"">financial assistance</span> and <span class=""highlight"">technology</span> transfer under the FCCC. He said voluntary commitments would create a new category of Parties under the FCCC and could destroy the unity of the G-77/China. He said the COP Presidency should remain neutral. QATAR, TOGO, CUBA, THAILAND and UGANDA also supported the G-77/China."

ZIMBABWE noted that <span class=""highlight"">flexibility</span> mechanisms already seek to further reduce non-Annex I <span class=""highlight"">emissions</span>. SAMOA acknowledged that the Convention and its objectives stood to gain from a further discussion of voluntary commitments, but discussion at this stage would be detrimental. Discussions should focus on what could be expected from developing countries and initiatives Annex I countries could take to assist developing countries. COLOMBIA suggested that the <span class=""highlight"">vulnerability</span> of developing nations, rather than their commitments, be discussed. CHILE said several developing countries were making serious efforts to limit <span class=""highlight"">GHG emissions and favored an exchange of views on voluntary cooperation, without entailing binding obligations or ignoring the principle of common but differentiated responsibility.</span>"
cdm projects|cdm|base year,"The US expressed regret that divisions among Parties would prevent delegates from putting all the issues on the table at this session. She said that locking doors to discussion would hinder understanding. An open and full discussion on options could clarify a number of questions. These include: how Parties would join Annex B; how <span class=""highlight"">base years</span> would be determined; how Parties would develop targets; and whether Parties would still be able to host <span class=""highlight"">CDM</span> projects. With JAPAN and CANADA, NEW ZEALAND supported a discussion on this item. He said if this were not done, the President should use her prerogative to facilitate informal consultations. NORWAY supported the right of a Party to bring forward an issue for discussion, but left the method of conducting the discussion to the discretion of the President."

IPCC Chair Robert Watson briefed SBSTA on the status of the Third Assessment Report (TAR) and four IPCC special reports. He said the TAR, which will be comprehensive and cover the complete range of scientific, technical, economic and social issues associated with climate change, will be policy relevant but not policy prescriptive. He said the philosophy of the TAR would embrace the concept of sustainable development and would attempt to place the issue of climate change more centrally within the socio-economic context. Issues of particular policy relevance would include, inter alia, the links between local, regional and global environmental issues and the trade impacts of the ratified Kyoto Protocol.</span>"

The Special Report on <span class=""highlight"">LUCF</span>, required to operationalize the relevant articles of the <span class=""highlight"">Kyoto Protocol</span>, will be completed by May 2000. He stressed the necessity for enhancement of scientific and technological <span class=""highlight"">infrastructure</span> in developing countries. The Secretariat introduced the documents related to <span class=""highlight"">LUCF</span> (FCCC/CP/1998/INF.4; FCCC/CP/1998/MISC. 1 and Add.1; FCCC/CP/1998/MISC.9 and Add.1)."
intergovernmental panel on climate change|forest|kyoto protocol,"Paul Maclons (South Africa) and Maciej Sadowski (Poland) reported on a recent workshop they co-chaired at the request of SBSTA-8. The workshop focused on data availability based on definitions used by Parties and international organizations, including their implications, in relation to <span class=""highlight"">Kyoto Protocol</span> Article 3.3 (<span class=""highlight"">forests</span>). The workshop coincided with an <span class=""highlight"">IPCC</span> expert meeting that aimed to prepare an outline for the special report. The Co-Chairs noted that SBSTA may need to clarify whether and when the <span class=""highlight"">IPCC</span> should develop detailed tables, formats and instructions for addressing the implications of the <span class=""highlight"">Kyoto Protocol</span> on the Revised Guidelines for national greenhouse <span class=""highlight"">gas</span> (GHG) inventories."
forestry,"FAO reported on its recent activities related to climate change. UGANDA stressed the need for comprehensive discussion of FCCC Articles 5 and 6 (public awareness) at the political, technical and grassroots level. BRAZIL underscored that SBSTA must look at <span class=""highlight"">forestry</span> issues from the perspective of climate change. He noted that this issue alone could undermine the <span class=""highlight"">Kyoto Protocol</span> if the COP takes a wrong decision on how to account for its influence on GHG concentrations."
agriculture|additional activities|forest|sink,"NORWAY said the workshop revealed that credits for <span class=""highlight"">carbon sinks under Protocol Article 3.3 (forests) might be negative, while the forest, as a whole, remains a sink. He said it was important that the discussions on definitions take this into account. SWITZERLAND, with the MARSHALL ISLANDS, favored deferring work related to Articles 3.3 and 3.4 (agricultural soils) until the IPCC special report is available. CANADA highlighted the capacity of soils to sequester carbon and noted the opportunity this presented to farmers in pursuing sustainable land management practices. With ICELAND, AUSTRALIA and JAPAN, he supported the US offer to host a SBSTA workshop in 1999. ICELAND favored continuing SBSTAÂ’s dialogue on sinks, focusing on, inter alia: selection criteria for additional activities, and modalities, rules and guidelines for the implementation of Protocol Article 3.4.</span>"
intergovernmental panel on climate change|sink|lulucf|biodiversity,"MAURITIUS said reduction of anthropogenic <span class=""highlight"">emissions</span> should not be forgotten when discussing <span class=""highlight"">sinks</span>. The PHILIPPINES, the MARSHALL ISLANDS and ARGENTINA supported an increase in the <span class=""highlight"">IPCC</span> budget to ensure full participation by developing country experts. The EU suggested preparation of a timeframe for the submission of the special report of the <span class=""highlight"">IPCC</span>. INDONESIA suggested linking the issue of <span class=""highlight"">LUCF</span> in the Protocol to other international environmental agreements, such as the Convention on <span class=""highlight"">Biological Diversity</span>. MEXICO stressed the need to examine links between local, regional and global environmental issues. BARBADOS said science should guide the COP on <span class=""highlight"">LUCF</span>. GREENPEACE said the <span class=""highlight"">IPCC</span> should examine the possibility that certain definitional judgements may result in perverse or negative incentives. The <span class=""highlight"">IPCC</span> Chair assured delegates that their concerns would be taken into account in preparing the report."
intergovernmental panel on climate change|lulucf,"The US questioned the <span class=""highlight"">IPCC</span> on the relationship between the Convention and the <span class=""highlight"">Montreal Protocol</span> processes. He underscored the ancillary benefits of sequestration activities and said excluding these would violate the Convention. AUSTRALIA said SBSTAÂ’s work on <span class=""highlight"">LUCF</span> should be parallel to and linked with the <span class=""highlight"">IPCC</span>Â’s work. He said SBSTA-9 should develop a draft decision for COP-4 elaborating a work plan for <span class=""highlight"">development</span> of modalities, rules and guidelines relating to <span class=""highlight"">LUCF</span>. JAPAN submitted two papers relating to Articles 3.3 and 3.4 containing items to be examined and supporting the work schedule agreed at SBSTA-8."
greenhouse gas emissions|emission|gas,"ICELAND submitted a draft decision that provides for process <span class=""highlight"">emissions</span> from a single project, coming into operation after 1990 and contributing more than five percent, in the first commitment period, to the total <span class=""highlight"">greenhouse gas emissions of an Annex B Party, to be reported separately and not in the national totals. This would allow the party to exceed its assigned amount provided that the total emissions of the Party are less than 0.05% of Annex I emissions in 1990. Iceland said this was necessary in small economies, as the proportional impact of single projects is very high.</span>"
emission|reducing emissions|kyoto protocol,"MARSHALL ISLANDS, supported by BRAZIL, BARBADOS and TUVALU, said the draft decision would lead to special dispensations prior to the <span class=""highlight"">Kyoto Protocol</span>Â’s <span class=""highlight"">entry into force</span> and could create an incentive for <span class=""highlight"">emissions</span> increases in Annex I countries. With AUSTRIA, CANADA and BARBADOS, he requested more time for consultations. AUSTRALIA recognized the impact of special projects on small economies and supported establishing guidelines and methodologies to specify circumstances under which special projects could be accommodated. CANADA and BRAZIL said the draft decision could set a precedent affecting the integrity of the Protocol. BRAZIL noted that the <span class=""highlight"">Kyoto Protocol</span> provides for mechanisms enabling Annex I Parties to seek lower- cost alternatives for <span class=""highlight"">emission</span> reductions."

MAURITANIA called on the Secretariat to provide more detailed information regarding the Parties that provide and receive <span class=""highlight"">funds</span>. BOLIVIA suggested a mandate be given to the Secretariat to investigate current practice under Articles 4.8 and 4.9. The US and CANADA indicated that the issues raised by Articles 4.8 and 4.9 and the subsequent decisions should be separate. With AUSTRALIA, they said the issue should be considered in a non- political manner. The EU acknowledged the concerns of developing countries and suggested prioritizing the <span class=""highlight"">development</span> of effective mitigation measures and the compilation of technical information."

A review of the <span class=""highlight"">AIJ</span> <span class=""highlight"">pilot phase</span> for COP-5 will support the <span class=""highlight"">development</span> of this work. POLAND observed that a review of the process could explain why some countries are excluded and resolve some of the concerns of the G-77/CHINA. After an extensive debate, the co-chairs indicated that informal negotiations would be held on this matter."

Some developing country delegates explained they were determined to hold out for an extension of the <span class=""highlight"">pilot phase</span> to allow more countries to gain experience prior to the implementation of the <span class=""highlight"">CDM</span>. One NGO observer suggested, however, that the US may pay a high price for its position on voluntary commitments if the <span class=""highlight"">flexibility</span> mechanisms are delayed. This could result in <span class=""highlight"">uncertainty</span> about Annex B PartiesÂ’ commitment to the Protocol and their preparedness to tackle GHG <span class=""highlight"">emissions</span>.

The G-77/CHINA reiterated the need for the <span class=""highlight"">flexibility</span> mechanisms to proceed step- by-step. MEXICO said quotas on implementation would be inappropriate and <span class=""highlight"">flexibility</span> on sustainable <span class=""highlight"">development</span> criteria is required. BRAZIL said the <span class=""highlight"">CDM</span> should not be operational before ratification of the Protocol and implementation of domestic measures.

He said <span class=""highlight"">domestic actions</span> should be the primary means of <span class=""highlight"">emissions</span> reductions and the mechanisms should be supplemental. He called for the definition of a quantitative and qualitative ceiling based on equitable terms. SWITZERLAND suggested the creation of a <span class=""highlight"">compliance mechanism</span>. The EU, SWITZERLAND and SLOVENIA said COP- 4 should agree on as many principles as possible and adopt detailed schedules on enacting the <span class=""highlight"">Kyoto Protocol</span>. AUSTRALIA said the <span class=""highlight"">flexibility</span> mechanisms were to be open, market- based, transparent, <span class=""highlight"">cost effective</span> and equitable; provide comprehensive coverage, including <span class=""highlight"">sinks</span>; and be fungible.

cdm|baselines|funding|flexibility mechanisms|flexibility|private sector,"With CANADA, the US and NORWAY, JAPAN underscored the importance of: addressing the <span class=""highlight"">flexibility</span> mechanisms in parallel, reaching early agreement; and developing a work plan for unresolved issues. He favored giving priority to technical issues. Supported by CANADA and the US, he opposed quantitative ceilings for reductions achieved through the <span class=""highlight"">flexibility</span> mechanisms, noting there is no ceiling on transfers of assigned amounts under Protocol Article 4 (Â“<span class=""highlight"">bubble</span>Â”). On the <span class=""highlight"">CDM</span>, he favored: transparency; inclusion of <span class=""highlight"">sink</span> projects; <span class=""highlight"">private sector</span> involvement; use of public <span class=""highlight"">funds</span> to ensure equitable geographical distribution of projects; and a standardized and/or project-by- project approach for <span class=""highlight"">baselines</span>.

SENEGAL said if developing countries were to meet their commitments, capacity <span class=""highlight"">development</span> should accompany <span class=""highlight"">technology</span> transfer. The US opposed the G-77/China proposal for a new <span class=""highlight"">technology</span> transfer mechanism as it would be difficult to agree on its terms of reference. ARGENTINA, with AOSIS, stressed the need to consider adaptation as well as mitigation. He supported a role for the Secretariat in linking providers and receivers of <span class=""highlight"">technology</span> and for international organizations in providing resources."
technology|technology transfer,"With GRENADA and KOREA, CHINA emphasized the role of national governments and international organizations and said <span class=""highlight"">technology</span> transfer should be on non- commercial and preferential terms. She added that transfer of <span class=""highlight"">technology</span> relates to the Convention and should not be linked to the <span class=""highlight"">Kyoto Protocol</span>. She questioned assessment of experiences, noting minimal progress in <span class=""highlight"">technology</span> transfer since 1992, and favored focusing on existing technologies over assessment of emerging technologies."

KOREA and CANADA supported work on inventories for sources of <span class=""highlight"">new technologies</span> and gap identification. AUSTRALIA supported analysis of barriers to <span class=""highlight"">technology</span> transfer and suggested SBSTA draw on its roster of experts. He proposed the establishment of an Internet-based network to enhance information dissemination."
technology|industry|technology transfer,"With the US, KOREA said debates on conceptual issues should not impede progress of the work programme. The US added that <span class=""highlight"">technology</span> transfer should be practical, sector-specific and driven by country priorities. He proposed that the Secretariat prepare a report on <span class=""highlight"">technology</span> transfer and <span class=""highlight"">development</span> efforts by Parties for consideration by SBSTA at its next session and endorsed the SecretariatÂ’s proposal to establish a consultative process to develop consensus on next steps. IRAN favored encouraging participation of government and private <span class=""highlight"">industries</span> in <span class=""highlight"">technology</span> transfer."

The EU and the Â“Umbrella GroupÂ” distributed draft decisions and discussion documents. Other Parties, including G-77/CHINA, called for more time to consider the volume of documentation. Several developing country Parties supported addressing a wider range of issues related to the <span class=""highlight"">flexibility</span> mechanisms, including <span class=""highlight"">technology</span> transfer, <span class=""highlight"">adverse impacts</span>, methodologies, reporting and compliance. Two <span class=""highlight"">small island</span> states supported a package of 11 themes for the work programme.

The Subsidiary Body for Scientific and Technological Advice (SBSTA) discussed research and systematic observation and other matters. In the afternoon and evening, contact groups discussed non-Annex I communications, <span class=""highlight"">technology</span> transfer, FCCC Articles 4.8 and 4.9 (<span class=""highlight"">adverse effects</span> on developing countries), the <span class=""highlight"">financial mechanism</span> and Articles 4.2(a) and (b) (review of commitments)."
flexibility|flexibility mechanisms,"The SBI and SBSTA discussed preparations for the first session of the Conference of Parties serving as the Meeting of the Parties to the Protocol (COP/MOP-1). The Chairs introduced their draft decision (FCCC/CP/1998/3) and invited comment. SAUDI ARABIA said preparations were needed for all Protocol articles, not just the <span class=""highlight"">flexibility</span> mechanisms. He stressed that Protocol Articles 3.14 and 2.3 (minimization of <span class=""highlight"">adverse effects</span> on developing countries) had not been adequately addressed. He suggested convening a separate contact group, discussing the issues in the contact group on FCCC Articles 4.8 and 4.9 or in the one on <span class=""highlight"">flexibility</span> mechanisms. VENEZUELA, BANGLADESH, UNITED ARAB EMIRATES, IRAN, SYRIA, KUWAIT, LEBANON, NIGERIA, GAMBIA, ECUADOR, ALGERIA, MOROCCO and INDONESIA supported SAUDI ARABIA."
compliance system,"SWITZERLAND supported the draft decision but suggested possible amendments to the timeframe and scope of work. The US proposed amending the decision to reflect the differing legal status of the Convention and the Protocol. The EU, supported by MONACO, noted the need to specify ways to facilitate cooperation and stressed coordination of <span class=""highlight"">IPCC</span> and FCCC activities through a joint working group. He proposed establishing a <span class=""highlight"">compliance mechanism</span> and scheduling a meeting for early 1999. JAPAN noted the need for time for consultation and difficulties in combining ongoing work under the FCCC and the Protocol. He opposed deadlines for setting compliance procedures until the mechanisms were elaborated. CANADA called for a balance between the Convention and the Protocol and said Protocol issues need attention so that Parties will ratify it."
flexibility|flexibility mechanisms,"The Chair said no separate contact groups would be established. SAUDI ARABIA called for a work plan and timeline on Article 3.14 for COP/MOP 1, and said that progress on Article 3.14 should follow an approach similar to Protocol Articles 6, 12 and 17 (<span class=""highlight"">flexibility</span> mechanisms). The Chair indicated that no work plan or timetable for any of the articles in question would be developed, but these items will be explored because they are linked. Espen RÃ¸nneberg (Marshall Islands) will consult on preparatory issues to COP/MOP-1."

Parties indicated the value of the GCOS Report and the significance of its work. As a result, Parties called for expansion of research and systematic observation, many highlighting the need to focus research and systematic observation systems on developing countries and issues that were relevant to them to combat the deterioration of these systems. MAURITIUS, TANZANIA and SAUDI ARABIA called on the subsidiary bodies to instruct the <span class=""highlight"">GEF</span> to provide <span class=""highlight"">funding</span> for research and systematic observations in developing countries."
mrv|annex i national communications|base year,"Chair Chow explained that the methodological issues relating to <span class=""highlight"">Annex I national communications</span> will be discussed at an expert workshop to be held in December by the Secretariat (FCCC/SBSTA/1998/7, FCCC/SBSTA/1998/8 FCCC/SBSTA/1998/Misc.6 and ADD.1). The Secretariat provided a background to these issues, explained work conducted and previous meetings held, and described the plan for <span class=""highlight"">development</span> of appropriate guidelines. The conclusions of the workshop will be discussed in SBSTA-10. John Christensen (UNEP) provided a background to an international collaborative report on methodological issues. The US called for the resolution of issues and expected to use them to develop guidelines and national <span class=""highlight"">measurement</span> systems that could be ratified by COP-6. The US proposed that the December workshop consider methodological, reporting, review and assessment issues. NORWAY sought continual re-evaluation of inventory data including <span class=""highlight"">base years</span> as methodologies improve. Chairman Chow proposed that he prepare a draft decision for consideration by SBSTA."
montreal protocol|hfcs|hydrofluorocarbons|perfluorocarbons|emission|industry,"With SWITZERLAND, the EU recognized that there is a link between the Montreal and <span class=""highlight"">Kyoto Protocols</span>. He requested the subsidiary bodies to provide a list of available technologies to limit and reduce <span class=""highlight"">emissions</span> of <span class=""highlight"">HFCs</span> and <span class=""highlight"">PFCs</span>. The US, with AUSTRALIA, said there should be coordination between international environmental agreements, but the process required careful consideration given the possible implication on <span class=""highlight"">industry</span>. He proposed that SBSTA consider the impact of the phase out of substances covered under the <span class=""highlight"">Montreal Protocol</span> and asked that they consult with that body. Chairman Chow proposed that he hold consultations on this matter."
adverse effects/impacts,"The contact group on the implementation of Article 4(8) and (9) (<span class=""highlight"">adverse effects</span> on developing countries), chaired by Bo Kjellen (Sweden) and Mohammad Reza Salamat (Iran) met to discuss a non-paper prepared by the Chairs. The G-77/CHINA suggested requesting the Annex I Parties to include information on possible impacts in their national communications. Discussion revolved around inter alia: the need for information on the <span class=""highlight"">adverse effects</span> of climate change and the impacts of response measures; the nature of information needed; the party responsible for providing the information; and the right forum to present the information. SAUDI ARABIA, LIBYA and other developing countries stressed that information be provided by Parties that had capacity and resources. The US, with JAPAN, CANADA and others, objected to the proposal, as it was impractical if not impossible to assess impacts outside their borders. The Chairs took the views of Parties under advisement."
technology|technology transfer mechanism|technology transfer|know-how,"The Contact group on <span class=""highlight"">technology</span> discussed <span class=""highlight"">technology</span> transfer issues and a draft decision for the COP. Three draft decisions proposed by the US, G-77/China and the EU (FCCC/CP/1998/MISC.5/Add.3) were circulated. The US said communications between Parties were hindered by the differing conceptual understandings of the issues. He said that <span class=""highlight"">technology</span> transfer should be based on country specific needs and proposed that reference be made to successful programmes. He supported the Secretariat's proposal for a consultative process that would facilitate dialogue between Parties. The G-77/China proposal focused on identifying means of linking the issues and providing an interface between the providers of <span class=""highlight"">technology</span> and the recipients. It proposed a <span class=""highlight"">technology</span> transfer mechanism (TTM) Â“to assist developing country Parties to obtain their needed environmentally sound technologies and <span class=""highlight"">know-how</span> conducive to addressing climate change on non-commercial and preferential terms and thus contribute to the ultimate objective of the convention.Â” There was consensus on the capacity building section of the G-77/China proposal, which called for efforts to enhance endogenous capacities and provide enabling environments."
technology transfer|technology,"The US opposed the reference to Â“non-commercial, preferential termsÂ” citing its rejection when the Convention was being negotiated in favor of the market which was understood as the best way to proceed. SIERRA LEONE said the failure of the <span class=""highlight"">market approach</span> to <span class=""highlight"">technology</span> transfer was the reason to deliberate on how to proceed. The EU supported AUSTRALIA in proposing a <span class=""highlight"">clearinghouse</span> mechanism similar to the one under the Convention on <span class=""highlight"">Biodiversity</span>. He opposed the creation of a new <span class=""highlight"">financial mechanism</span>. The delegates debated, inter alia: the necessity, possible form and functions of the TTM; issues relating to the transfer of public domain <span class=""highlight"">technology</span>; the features of a consultative process; and the role of dialogue between Parties."
technology|technology transfer,"Official negotiations at COP-4 have mellowed considerably since MondayÂ’s confrontational but cathartic exchanges. Some observers suggest, however, that politically sensitive talks are underway behind the scenes. One delegate noted that <span class=""highlight"">technology</span> transfer threatens to become a linchpin issue for these meetings. He expressed concern that some developed countries have underestimated the degree of significance the G-77/China places on the issue, perhaps to the point of halting negotiations unless the COP takes a decision. Some observers suggested that the consultations by the host Party have been initiated and may continue over the weekend."
extreme event|vulnerable,"COP-4 President Maria Julia Alsogaray (Argentina) offered condolences to the Caribbean and Latin American countries recently devastated by <span class=""highlight"">hurricane</span> Mitch. She noted that over the past year floods, fires, <span class=""highlight"">droughts</span> and <span class=""highlight"">hurricanes</span> have profoundly effected countries around the world and suggested that Â“Mother NatureÂ” was reminding delegates that urgent action was needed. EL SALVADOR, for the CENTRAL AMERICAN GROUP, said these events should remind all participants of their <span class=""highlight"">vulnerability</span> to <span class=""highlight"">disasters</span> and should prompt action."
land use|land-use change|forestry|technology transfer|technology,"SBSTA Chair Kok Kee Chow reported that SBSTA had completed initial consideration of all its sub-items. On <span class=""highlight"">development</span> and <span class=""highlight"">transfer of technology, he said a contact group had met once and would meet again. Deliberations on research and systematic observation have progressed rapidly. On the proposal from Brazil, he said draft conclusions would be forthcoming on Monday. On land use change and forestry, he reported that the contact group Co-Chairs were drafting a decision. Consultations are ongoing on the impact of single project emissions in the commitment period and are nearing conclusions. On review of AIJ, the Chair said the informal consultations were making good progress. On Protocol mechanisms, a joint contact group has held an initial meeting to exchange views and will meet again.</span>"
technology|technology transfer mechanism|technology transfer,"On the reports of the subsidiary bodies, G-77/CHINA reiterated the importance of <span class=""highlight"">technology</span> transfer to developing countries and proposed the establishment of a <span class=""highlight"">technology</span> transfer mechanism. He urged developed country Parties to prioritize the implementation of the Convention over economic and political considerations. The RUSSIAN FEDERATION requested the subsidiary body chairs to elaborate on the difficulties they have encountered and how these can be overcome. SBSTA Chair Chow said the issues were still under discussion in the designated contact groups."
desertification|biodiversity,"The CBD Secretariat highlighted the linkages between the <span class=""highlight"">desertification</span>, <span class=""highlight"">biodiversity</span> and climate change conventions and the common concern of sustainable <span class=""highlight"">development</span> underlying their agenda. He spoke of CBD decisions that emphasized cooperation between the relevant Secretariats, in particular regarding management of information from Parties, provided to fulfil their commitments under the Conventions. The Secretariat said it was ready to act on areas of common and shared interest."
development|economies in transition|eit|energy efficiency|energy|private sector|renewable energy,"William Kennedy, Senior Officer for the European Bank for Reconstruction and <span class=""highlight"">Development</span> (EBRD), described activities, such as developing innovative <span class=""highlight"">financial mechanisms</span> and supporting the shift to market economy, undertaken in countries with <span class=""highlight"">economies in transition</span>, while considering the implications to the environment and climate change. Prodipto Ghosh, Senior Environment Specialist from the Asian <span class=""highlight"">Development</span> Bank, discussed the support provided to GHG abatement projects in the Asia-Pacific region. These included: supporting national initiatives, encouraging <span class=""highlight"">energy</span> efficiency and renewable <span class=""highlight"">energy</span> projects, preparing reports on <span class=""highlight"">national circumstances</span> (ALGAS reports) and supporting the <span class=""highlight"">development</span> of national communications in 11 countries. The Chief of the Environmental Division of the Inter-American <span class=""highlight"">Development</span> Bank, Walter Arensberg, presented information on four themes to help countries in Latin America and the Caribbean meet the challenges of climate change. These included: assisting the enhancement of relevant institutions, expanding the market for sustainable <span class=""highlight"">energy</span> to fit new mechanisms, providing financial and technical assistance to carry out global protection programs, and suggesting regulatory and institutional reforms for the <span class=""highlight"">private sector</span>."
funding|gef|financial mechanism,"The contact group on the <span class=""highlight"">financial mechanism</span>, chaired by John Ashe (Antigua and Barbuda) and Dan Reifsnyder (US), met to discuss additional guidance to and status of the Global Environmental Facility (<span class=""highlight"">GEF</span>). The group first discussed a draft decision presented by the G-77/CHINA (FCCC/CP/1998/MISC.3/Add.1). While the EU supported the overall framework of the G-77/China draft decision, with the US, he said it should not include <span class=""highlight"">funding</span> for stage II and III processes. AUSTRALIA indicated that he might support stage II efforts now and stage III."
technology|technology transfer,"The US tabled a draft decision that focused on: improvements at the operational level of the <span class=""highlight"">GEF</span>; resolving the status of and guidance to the <span class=""highlight"">GEF</span> in one draft decision; and <span class=""highlight"">GEF</span> support programs to assist developing countries in altering their policy and legal frameworks in support of <span class=""highlight"">technology</span> transfer. The G- 77/CHINA said this proposal did not adequately meet the needs of developing country Parties. A smaller informal group will meet to draft a decision for the contact group to consider at their next meeting."
cdm,"The joint contact group on mechanisms, chaired by Luiz Gylvan Meira Filho (Brazil) and Yvo de Boer (Netherlands) met on Friday to discuss a work programme prepared by the Co-Chairs. The G- 77/CHINA stressed the need for a clear section devoted to the nature and scope of the mechanisms to facilitate comparison. He added that the mechanisms should not exacerbate the economic disadvantage of certain countries, and called for the <span class=""highlight"">CDM</span> to be discussed on a priority basis. HONDURAS, supported by several Latin American countries, suggested expeditious creation of the <span class=""highlight"">CDM</span>, calling for an Â“interim phase approachÂ” to develop guidelines and rules. The US stressed parallel progress on all mechanisms. The EU preferred a general, rather than a detailed, debate. NEW ZEALAND stressed the importance of developing a timeline for discussion. Several Parties expressed concern about the length of the draft work programme. SWITZERLAND provided the Chairs with a two-page work programme. The contact group met on Saturday to continue discussion on the work programme, with a much-shortened version prepared by the Co-Chairs that included the Honduran Â“interim phaseÂ” proposal. After some discussion, the Chair acknowledged differences in views among the Parties, but said they were not incompatible. He suggested the Parties conduct informal discussions and reconvene on Monday."
technology|technology transfer mechanism|technology transfer,"The contact group on <span class=""highlight"">technology</span> met on Friday and Saturday to discuss the proposals for a draft decision put forward by the US, EU and G-77/China. The G-77/CHINA presented the principles of the proposed <span class=""highlight"">technology</span> transfer mechanism, drawing upon the US and EU proposals. Further functions or features would be determined as the process develops. The US reiterated its view on market based <span class=""highlight"">technology</span> transfer, noting that the <span class=""highlight"">Kyoto Protocol</span> places <span class=""highlight"">technology</span> transfer and the market at the core of the deliberations. Co-Chair Christ suggested the Â“cat,Â” as the process was referred to, could represent consultation and capacity, access and advice on barrier removals and <span class=""highlight"">technology</span> transfer. She cautioned against duplication of ongoing activities, such as the preparation of the <span class=""highlight"">IPCC</span> Special Report on Methodological and Technical Issues in <span class=""highlight"">Technology</span> Transfer. The PHILIPPINES questioned the need for further material compilations and said although market based transfer exists, it was not effective and required further measures. The Co-Chair proposed that the Secretariat integrate the three proposals. The delegates discussed the new draft at length and made significant progress. On Saturday evening, the meeting adjourned to allow further consultations on the outstanding issues relating to what to call the process."

Contact groups continued their deliberations on: non-Annex I communications; <span class=""highlight"">technology</span> transfer; the <span class=""highlight"">financial mechanism</span>; FCCC Articles 4.8 and 4.9; and the <span class=""highlight"">flexibility</span> mechanisms."
land-use change|forestry|land use,"SBSTA met to consider the reports, draft conclusions and decisions of the informal consultations and contact groups on: research and systematic observation (FCCC/SBSTA/1998/CRP.6); scientific and methodological aspects of the proposal by Brazil (FCCC/SBSTA/1998/L.7); <span class=""highlight"">land use</span> change and <span class=""highlight"">forestry</span> (FCCC/SBSTA/1998/CRP.7); and the relationship between efforts to protect the stratospheric <span class=""highlight"">ozone</span> layer and efforts to safeguard the global climate system (FCCC/SBSTA/1998/CRP.8)."
mrv|greenhouse gas emissions|gas|emission|observing systems,"Co-Chair Sue Barrell (Australia) presented the draft conclusions and decisions of the informal consultations on research and systematic observation (FCCC/SBSTA/1998/CRP.6). She said there was consensus on the urgent need to improve the quality, coverage and management of the reporting systems. The draft conclusions outlined decisions to develop an action plan to consider options for implementation, and requested the Secretariat to compile a report on priorities for action to improve global <span class=""highlight"">observing systems</span> in relation to the needs of the Convention. The RUSSIAN FEDERATION noted the need to support national meteorological systems. He proposed inclusion of systems for the <span class=""highlight"">measurement</span> of greenhouse <span class=""highlight"">gases</span> and other atmospheric components, reference to satellite systems for data collection and distinction between anthropogenic and natural climate change variations. He suggested that the draft be amended to indicate that national meteorological systems also measure <span class=""highlight"">greenhouse gas emissions. The Chair noted that the Global Atmosphere Watch covered the observation of greenhouse gases.</span>"
mrv|observing systems|greenhouse gas concentrations|global climate observing system,"Delegates debated references to atmospheric <span class=""highlight"">observing systems</span> and <span class=""highlight"">measurement</span> of greenhouse <span class=""highlight"">gas</span> concentrations and agreed to text that Â“urges Parties to actively support national meteorological and atmospheric <span class=""highlight"">observing systems</span>, including <span class=""highlight"">measurement</span> of greenhouse <span class=""highlight"">gases</span>.Â” Delegates also debated language requesting Parties to submit information on their participation in global climate <span class=""highlight"">observing systems</span> and requesting SBSTA to report to COP-5 on developments regarding observational networks. CHINA said guidelines on initial national communications from non-Annex I countries did not include reference to this information and submitting it was voluntary. MALAWI highlighted the need for <span class=""highlight"">financial support</span>. The UK suggested the Â“climate agendaÂ” draw on, inter alia, the information provided in the second national communication of Annex I Parties and the initial national communication of non- Annex I Parties as appropriate. The decision was adopted as amended."

SBSTA invited Parties to provide submissions on issues to be considered at the workshop. AOSIS stressed that <span class=""highlight"">IPCC</span> should be allowed to work independently. He called upon the Secretariat to support the participation of delegates from the <span class=""highlight"">most vulnerable group of countries in the second workshop. At the request of the RUSSIAN FEDERATION and other Parties, the title of the draft conclusion was amended to read Â“land use, land-use change and forestry.Â” The draft conclusions were adopted as amended.</span>"
intergovernmental panel on climate change,"The RUSSIAN FEDERATION suggested deleting the requirement of a Report from the Secretariat, as the <span class=""highlight"">IPCC</span> Report could provide the required information. The Chair clarified there would be two separate reports and was confident Parties would be able to reach credible conclusions. The CENTRAL AFRICAN REPUBLIC proposed deleting the requirement for the Secretariat to compile the conclusions of the joint workshop. The EU and CHINA opposed the suggestion as it would mean additional work for the <span class=""highlight"">IPCC</span>. The Chair clarified that the Secretariat was only to compile the information provided and not rewrite the <span class=""highlight"">IPCC</span> document. The RUSSIAN FEDERATION suggested requesting the Secretariat to compile only a three-page report. The draft decision was adopted, despite the objection of the Russian Federation."
compliance system,"Supported by the EU, SAMOA expressed concern over the absence of compliance in the COP agenda. He proposed the establishment of an ad hoc and open-ended group to consider the issues and report to the next COP. He said an effective and equitable <span class=""highlight"">compliance regime</span> should ensure consistency in its application to all the obligations under the Protocol. It should: provide compliance responses that reflect the common but <span class=""highlight"">differentiated responsibilities</span> of Parties; respect the capabilities of Parties; reflect the institutions and procedures that embody the principles of due process and geographical balance of interests; and operate in a timely manner. The Chair said that the issue is being addressed in the consultations on the preparation for COP/MOP-1."

In presenting the modifications to the document, the Co-Chair drew attention to the deadline for the preparation of a miscellaneous document, compiling information on projects and programmes on cooperative approaches to <span class=""highlight"">technology</span> transfer. CHINA said a <span class=""highlight"">technology</span> transfer mechanism would facilitate progress and assist all Parties in fulfilling the Convention objectives. The draft decision included an annex with a list of functions for a possible process defined by the G-77/China and a preliminary list of issues and questions. The US proposed the inclusion of questions relating to the role of the <span class=""highlight"">private sector</span> as well as on measures that can create an appropriate <span class=""highlight"">enabling environment</span> for their involvement. The delegates discussed the modifications on the text. As of 6 p.m., delegates were debating what the outcome of the consultative process would be called."

Prior to the meeting, the chairs circulated a draft decision, which decided that the basic elements for further analysis should include: the identification of <span class=""highlight"">adverse effects</span>; determination of the impacts of implementation measures in developing countries; the identification of the specific needs and concerns of developing country Parties arising from such <span class=""highlight"">adverse effects</span> and impacts; and identifying further necessary actions related to <span class=""highlight"">funding</span>, insurance and the transfer of <span class=""highlight"">technology</span> in order to meet the needs of developing countries. A programme of work was proposed that included: an expert workshop (April, 1999); further discussion in subsidiary bodies (SBSTA and SBI 10, June 1999); identification of needs for further information needed (COP-5, October 1999); and decisions made (COP-6, October 2000). As of 10:30 pm, delegates were unable to reach agreement and will continue discussion."
cdm,"The contact group on mechanisms met to debate a draft work programme on mechanisms. The G-77/CHINA submitted a proposed work programme containing an extensive list of issues, embodying a Â“step-by-stepÂ” approach and prioritizing the <span class=""highlight"">CDM</span>. In response, the US, supported by CANADA and AUSTRALIA, suggested the contact group address four questions: what type of decision should be made, when, by whom, and how it should move forward. He added that there were two options, negotiate the items or keep the list of items open. The EU said the G-77/China draft programme lacked inter alia, a clear timeline, deadlines and allocation of work to different bodies. They rejected the prioritization of work, calling for parallel <span class=""highlight"">development</span> of all three mechanisms. The Co-Chairs introduced a draft decision on mechanisms, taking into consideration the views expressed at the Group, admitting that it was outside their mandate. Australia said the issues settled at Kyoto should not be re-opened. As of 10:30 p.m. the delegates were unable to reach agreement and were continuing deliberations. They will meet from 11:00am-2:00pm on Tuesday."

The EU reportedly supports a comprehensive regime and a work plan to establish it, but expressed concern that the US policy is unclear. No agreement was reached and some have reported that meaningful progress seems unlikely. Some G-77/CHINA delegates expressed increasing discomfort with the continuing focus on voluntary commitments presented in the BuenosAyres newspaper. Sentiment peaked when the paper published a survey suggesting that 66 countries of 130 surveyed desired debate on this topic."
technology|technology transfer,"The draft conclusions on <span class=""highlight"">technology</span> transfer (FCCC/SBSTA/1998/CRP.11) requested the SBSTA Chair to establish a consultative process, constituting regional workshops and meetings to implement FCCC Article 4.5 (<span class=""highlight"">technology</span> transfer). Parties are invited to provide submissions to the Secretariat by 15 March 1999 in response to the issues listed in the Annex to the decision."
technology|private sector|technology transfer mechanism|technology transfer,"Delegates adopted most of the text unchanged, modifying the preamble to reflect the role of the <span class=""highlight"">private sector</span> in some countries. A paragraph requesting SBSTA to establish a consultative process to consider the issues listed in the Annex engendered debate. The G-77/CHINA favored retaining reference to a <span class=""highlight"">technology</span> transfer mechanism and considering the paragraph along with a bracketed reference in the Annex, which required consideration of appropriate mechanisms for <span class=""highlight"">technology</span> transfer with the UNFCCC. The PHILIPPINES suggested a body was needed to operationalize the process, adding that experts involved in the consultative process should be from the FCCC roster of experts. The US, with the EU, said the aim of the consultative process should be Â“meaningful and effective action.Â” The G-77/CHINA favored Â“<span class=""highlight"">technology</span> transfer mechanism,Â” but indicated willingness to accept Â“meaningful and effective actionÂ” if brackets were removed from the Annex."

Chair Chow reported that participants in the afternoon's consultations had agreed to let the Chair make a proposal. He proposed the following: to achieve agreement on a framework for meaningful and effective actions. The reference to <span class=""highlight"">technology</span> transfer mechanism would be deleted. The text would also have SBSTA draw from the roster of experts. A bracketed reference in the Annex would ask whether existing multilateral mechanisms were sufficient."
funding|gef|financial mechanism,"Co-Chair John Ashe (Antigua and Barbuda) presented the draft decision on the <span class=""highlight"">financial mechanism</span>. He noted that there were no brackets in the text, but one group had indicated its dissent. The EU bracketed paragraphs on <span class=""highlight"">GEF</span> <span class=""highlight"">funding</span> for implementing adaptation responses and meeting full agreed costs. The US bracketed language on international centers. The G-77/CHINA bracketed the entire text. The text was accepted with brackets. SBI then adopted the draft report of its ninth session (FCCC/SBSTA/1998/L.8)"
flexibility|flexibility mechanisms,"The contact group on <span class=""highlight"">flexibility</span> mechanisms considered the initial work programme on Protocol mechanisms. In addition to the G-77/China proposal submitted earlier, draft work programmes were submitted by AUSTRALIA (on behalf of CANADA, ICELAND, NEW ZEALAND, NORWAY, the RUSSIAN FEDERATION and the US), JAPAN, SWITZERLAND and the Co-Chairs. After extensive deliberations, Co- Chair Yvo de Boer (Netherlands) suggested textual amendments. The title of the work programme would include a footnote stating Â“the existence of elements in this list is without prejudice to inclusion of these items in the rules, modalities and guidelines developed for these mechanisms.Â” The discussion on principles would be limited to the Â“application of existing principles,Â” and the references to FCCC Articles 4.8 and 4.9 (<span class=""highlight"">adverse effects</span>) would be deleted."

On the review of progress under the <span class=""highlight"">AIJ</span> <span class=""highlight"">pilot phase</span>, Chair Cornelia Quennet- Thielen (Germany) presented a draft decision (FCCC/SB/1998/CRP.3) based on informal consultations. The G-77/CHINA opposed text on crediting for <span class=""highlight"">AIJ</span> <span class=""highlight"">pilot phase</span> projects and proposed an amendment on continuing the <span class=""highlight"">AIJ</span> <span class=""highlight"">pilot phase</span>, focusing on developing countries. The US and SLOVENIA opposed the change, noting it excluded certain groups of Parties. AUSTRALIA said incentives were needed for the <span class=""highlight"">private sector</span>.

He indicated that SBSTA agreed on five draft decisions, including: research and systematic observation (FCCC/CP/1998/L.4); scientific and methodological aspects of the proposal by Brazil (FCCC/SBSTA/1998/L.7); <span class=""highlight"">land-use</span> change and <span class=""highlight"">forestry</span> (FCCC/CP/1998.L.5); impact of single projects on <span class=""highlight"">emissions</span> in the commitment period (FCCC/CP/1998/L.8); and the relationship between efforts to protect the stratospheric <span class=""highlight"">ozone</span> layer and efforts to safeguard the global climate system; (FCCC/CP/1998/L.7). The draft decisions were later adopted by the COP without amendment. A draft decision on the <span class=""highlight"">development</span> and <span class=""highlight"">transfer of technology was prepared, although the Chair noted that two Parties have concerns that will likely be raised in the COP (FCCC/CP/19998/L.15).</span>"

A text of a possible decision on activities <span class=""highlight"">implemented jointly</span> (<span class=""highlight"">AIJ</span>) contains some brackets (FCCC/CP/1998/CRP.2). No decision on the <span class=""highlight"">flexibility</span> mechanisms was reached and two draft texts will be forwarded to the COP (FCCC/CP/1998/MISC.7 and Add.1). On preparations for COP/MOP-1, the text retains brackets and blank sections will be filled in later as information becomes available (FCCC/CP/1998/CRP.4). He indicated the group had a strong interest in compliance and a body may be needed to continue this work."
technology|technology transfer,"The President asked if a decision on the transfer of <span class=""highlight"">technology</span> could be adopted. The US said it was important to ensure consistency between this text and one concerning the <span class=""highlight"">GEF</span>. He requested that the item be held open. Delegates agreed to address the issue on Friday afternoon."
fuel,"TURKEY said it had presented the FCCC to Parliament for ratification. However, its Annex I and II status did not conform to the countryÂ’s economic circumstances. She requested resolution of this issue at COP-5. LIBYA expressed hope that the international community would prevent adverse <span class=""highlight"">economic impacts</span> from response measures. Sanctions have impeded environmental improvements to <span class=""highlight"">oil</span> production facilities, which violates international agreements."
policies and measures|adverse effects/impacts,"FORO DEL BUEN AYRE said the challenge facing COP-4 will lead to new roles for NGOs. He described efforts to improve Latin American regional NGO cooperation and supported local level action. GLOBE (Global Legislators Organization for a Balanced Environment) called on certain countries to end their Â“dance of the doomedÂ” and acknowledge that without <span class=""highlight"">equity</span> there can be no bankable success. He sought a contraction budget with a convergence mechanism that sets targets for all. Delegates could, on Friday the 13th, face a Â“full stop COPÂ” if they fail to include language of <span class=""highlight"">equity</span> into work programmes. ICFTU (International Confederation of Free Trade Unions) highlighted the potential of trade unions to effect change in the workplace. He said mitigation <span class=""highlight"">policies and measures</span> should minimize <span class=""highlight"">adverse effects</span> on workers and transition strategies were necessary."
additionality|supplementarity|cost effectiveness|private sector|business,"ICC (International Chamber of Commerce) and WBCSD (World <span class=""highlight"">Business</span> Council for Sustainable <span class=""highlight"">Development</span>) underscored the role of the <span class=""highlight"">private sector</span> and the potential of voluntary initiatives. They stressed, inter alia: transparency; low transaction costs; incentives for early action; fungibility; <span class=""highlight"">additionality</span> without barriers; and <span class=""highlight"">supplementarity</span> when <span class=""highlight"">cost effective</span>."
supplementarity,"ICLEI (International Council for Local Environmental Initiatives) outlined its Cities for Climate Protection Campaign, which supports, inter alia, domestic <span class=""highlight"">policies and measures</span>, increased support to <span class=""highlight"">local governments</span> and <span class=""highlight"">supplementarity</span>. The ARGENTINE MAYORSÂ’ ENVIRONMENTAL FORUM noted the recommendations of the first MayorsÂ’ Environmental Forum held in November 1998, which highlighted, inter alia: municipal autonomy; local environmental policies; federal support; and public participation."

business|energy,"BCSE (<span class=""highlight"">Business</span> Council for Sustainable <span class=""highlight"">Energy</span>) and the EUROPEAN <span class=""highlight"">BUSINESS</span> COUNCIL FOR A SUSTAINABLE <span class=""highlight"">ENERGY</span> FUTURE called for the adoption of work plans with deadlines for each <span class=""highlight"">flexibility</span> mechanism, the implementation of a strong liability system and support for model frameworks to encourage technological agreements between developed and developing countries."
nuclear|domestic action|compliance system|ecosystem|flexibility mechanisms|flexibility|energy,"CLIMATE ACTION NETWORK - EUROPE stated that <span class=""highlight"">domestic actions</span> by industrialized countries should be furthered and a strict <span class=""highlight"">compliance regime</span> established. <span class=""highlight"">Flexibility</span> mechanisms should not be a way for Parties to evade <span class=""highlight"">domestic action</span> and <span class=""highlight"">nuclear</span> <span class=""highlight"">energy</span> is not an appropriate solution. FRANCISCANS INTERNATIONAL linked GHG reduction to world <span class=""highlight"">peace</span> and urged, inter alia, more concern for <span class=""highlight"">ecosystems</span> and <span class=""highlight"">small island</span> states, <span class=""highlight"">equity</span>, rejection of consumerism and reverence for all creation."
kyoto protocol,"The US, THAILAND, PERU and TUVALU announced their signature of the <span class=""highlight"">Kyoto Protocol</span>. TRINIDAD and TOBAGO, on behalf of CARICOM and HAITI, said BAHAMAS will sign the Protocol this week.

PERU said the <span class=""highlight"">inaction</span> of developed countries sends dangerous signals to non-Annex I countries. NORWAY said developed countries must accept even more ambitious targets in the future. Recognizing the <span class=""highlight"">vulnerability</span> of <span class=""highlight"">small island</span> states, NEW ZEALAND called for support to AOSIS."
most vulnerable|vulnerable|vulnerable countries|technology transfer|technology|industry,"FRANCE noted that developing country <span class=""highlight"">emissions</span> are increasing and called for timely provision of <span class=""highlight"">financial support</span> and <span class=""highlight"">technology</span> transfer.

financial resources|funding|uncertainties|inaction|scientific uncertainty|technology transfer|technology,"The UK, with GHANA, said scientific <span class=""highlight"">uncertainty</span> should not be used as an excuse for <span class=""highlight"">inaction</span>. DENMARK called for a Buenos Aires deal that calls upon developed countries to commit themselves to provide additional <span class=""highlight"">funds</span> to developing countries and address their obligations under the FCCC and the Protocol. In return, developing countries must agree to work out the necessary national strategies to allow for a constructive review process. AOSIS called for a clear and ambitious timetable to elaborate the Protocol. The G-77/CHINA said their participation in mitigating climate change depends on the effective implementation of developed country Party commitments in the field of <span class=""highlight"">technology</span> transfer and <span class=""highlight"">financial resources</span>. JAPAN and the EU stressed the need to maintain the momentum of Kyoto, and with FINLAND, called for the creation of a clear and efficient work plan giving priority to developing country concerns. LATVIA supported the EU proposal for a Buenos Aires work plan."
cdm|flexibility mechanisms|kyoto protocol|flexibility|technology|technology transfer,"GHANA said the challenges of climate change <span class=""highlight"">mitigation and adaptation</span> present an additional burden to developing countries and with the CARICOM states, ICELAND, AUSTRALIA, the US, SAUDI ARABIA, NEW ZEALAND and the G-77/CHINA called for elaboration of mechanisms under the <span class=""highlight"">Kyoto Protocol</span>. The CENTRAL AMERICAN STATES stressed the importance of <span class=""highlight"">sinks</span> and supported the G-77/China proposal to prioritize the <span class=""highlight"">CDM</span> and operationalize it by 1 January 2000. With CHILE, he proposed an interim phase of the <span class=""highlight"">CDM</span>. IRELAND supported the EU call for clear qualitative and quantitative ceilings on the use of the <span class=""highlight"">flexibility</span> mechanisms. The COOK ISLANDS, MARSHALL ISLANDS, NAURU, NIUE, TUVALU, ALGERIA and the CARICOM States expressed concern that the <span class=""highlight"">flexibility</span> mechanisms are a way of avoiding domestic responsibility. THAILAND said the <span class=""highlight"">CDM</span> should not be the sole means of <span class=""highlight"">technology</span> transfer."

THAILAND supported <span class=""highlight"">north-south</span> and <span class=""highlight"">south-south</span> partnerships based on <span class=""highlight"">equity</span> and the principle of common but <span class=""highlight"">differentiated responsibility</span>. SPAIN called for progress on developing a process of <span class=""highlight"">technology</span> transfer and efforts to address the issue of public awareness and <span class=""highlight"">education</span>. FRANCE called for a common approach to collective measures and said mechanisms should be based on a reliable system of compliance that includes sanctions. CROATIA said the <span class=""highlight"">flexibility</span> mechanisms must be equitable, i.e. open, transparent, verifiable and non- discriminatory. EGYPT emphasized the equal treatment of the three <span class=""highlight"">flexibility</span> mechanisms and suggested that part of the proceeds from these mechanisms be mobilized to finance the transfer of adaptation <span class=""highlight"">technology</span> for developing countries. BRAZIL underscored the <span class=""highlight"">CDM</span> as a means of inducing new and mostly private <span class=""highlight"">investment</span>, and suggested that it be project based and include all countries. CANADA described the <span class=""highlight"">CDM</span> as a Â“win-win- win mechanism,Â” i.e. win for the environment, win for sustainable <span class=""highlight"">development</span> and win for the developed countries, as they would be able to meet the <span class=""highlight"">Kyoto Protocol</span> targets. VENEZUELA said <span class=""highlight"">CDM</span> projects must ensure net contribution to sustainable <span class=""highlight"">development</span> in the host country; avoid hidden costs; and use project-based rather than sectoral or national <span class=""highlight"">baselines</span> to avoid future imposition of targets."
cdm|technology transfer|technology,"ARGENTINA said <span class=""highlight"">emissions</span> trading was an innovative solution to market failure. POLAND called for final decisions on the mechanisms at COP-5 and proposed a <span class=""highlight"">pilot phase</span> for <span class=""highlight"">emissions</span> trading. KOREA opposed any limits on <span class=""highlight"">CDM</span>. MEXICO stressed open criteria and a progressive approach to <span class=""highlight"">CDM</span> that could foster immediate and simple actions without artificial limits, not contained in the Protocol. BOTSWANA emphasized the role of the <span class=""highlight"">CDM</span> in assisting developing countries and urged progress on elaborating this mechanism. MOROCCO said the imbalance of projects under the <span class=""highlight"">AIJ</span> <span class=""highlight"">pilot phase</span> was inequitable and ZIMBABWE recommended its extension. MALAYSIA called for the incorporation of <span class=""highlight"">technology</span> transfer and the <span class=""highlight"">financial mechanism</span> into the Protocol mechanisms."
economies in transition|flexibility mechanisms|flexibility,"GREECE supported agreement on clear principles, modalities, rules and guidelines for the <span class=""highlight"">flexibility</span> mechanisms including ceilings on their use. SOUTH AFRICA supported <span class=""highlight"">development</span> of a clear programme of work, establishment of an intersessional working group and a timeframe to ensure the Kyoto targets are met. UKRAINE stressed establishment of a work programme for implementation of Kyoto obligations by Annex I Parties. He said revival in <span class=""highlight"">transition economies</span> will lead to inevitable increases in <span class=""highlight"">GHG emissions, but these countries will achieve internal reductions. He opposed the Â“revisionÂ” of decisions taken at Kyoto.</span>"
compliance system,"Several Parties including DENMARK, VENEZUELA, POLAND, AUSTRALIA, FRANCE, the EU and the US called for the establishment of a coherent, effective and strong <span class=""highlight"">compliance system</span>. The G-77/CHINA called for a decision on compliance at COP-4. GERMANY suggested a ceiling for mechanisms and, with FRANCE, supported the inclusion of sanctions in the <span class=""highlight"">compliance system</span>."
energy,"With BENIN and ZIMBABWE, CHINA cautioned against the COP losing focus on the Convention. He opposed the argument that a global problem demands a global response and rejected <span class=""highlight"">emission</span> reduction or limitation conditions. SWEDEN urged delegates to work to increase awareness, understanding and support for change and, with FINLAND, applauded the role of NGOs in the environmental agenda. VENEZUELA cautioned against allowing distractions from the main issues by discussing items not on the COP-4 agenda. ECUADOR supported closer coordination with other UN Conventions, particularly the CBD. NEPAL stressed regional environmental cooperation and opposed undue limits on their <span class=""highlight"">energy</span> <span class=""highlight"">consumption</span>."

The GAMBIA called for membership of the Multilateral Consultative Committee and participation in the <span class=""highlight"">CDM</span> on an equitable geographical basis. SENEGAL said the debt burden was a serious hindrance to sustainable <span class=""highlight"">development</span> and the marginalization of Africa made <span class=""highlight"">equity</span> a particular concern. INDIA stressed the distinction between luxury and survival <span class=""highlight"">emissions</span>. ZAMBIA said climate change programmes should be linked to <span class=""highlight"">poverty</span> eradication. Recognizing that the lack of multilateral financing constitutes a major obstacle to implementing the Convention and noting the slow and complex process to access <span class=""highlight"">GEF</span> <span class=""highlight"">funds</span>, DJIBOUTI supported the establishment of an independent <span class=""highlight"">financial mechanism</span> to finance the <span class=""highlight"">CDM</span> for poor countries."
cdm|flexibility mechanisms|kyoto protocol|flexibility,"BURUNDI underscored the need for improved access to technological information and knowledge and capacity building, especially for African delegates participating in the climate change process.

SWITZERLAND called for coordination between various international environmental agreements, particularly the Montreal and <span class=""highlight"">Kyoto Protocols</span>. PARAGUAY highlighted its interest in the potential of the <span class=""highlight"">flexibility</span> mechanisms."
flexibility|kyoto protocol|flexibility mechanisms,"Some delegates noted the US proposal to include voluntary commitments in the draft text on <span class=""highlight"">flexibility</span> mechanisms on Tuesday changed the tone of debate, resulted in pointed attacks from the G-77/China and hindered the spirit of compromise. Other delegates suggested that current backroom discussions were slowly making progress and that the termÂ“<span class=""highlight"">flexibility</span> mechanismsÂ” was being replaced by <span class=""highlight"">Kyoto Protocol</span> Mechanisms. As one delegate asked, Â“flexible for whom?Â” Some observers said they expected other countries to state they would assume voluntary commitments on the final day of the COP."
